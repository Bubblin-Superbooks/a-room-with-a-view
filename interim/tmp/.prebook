The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got tempted\ninto cigarettes. It is a great secret, but I am glad to say that she is\nwriting another novel. She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that\nshe had got up all the local colour—this novel is to be about modern\nItaly; the other was historical—but that she could not start till she\nhad an idea. First she tried Perugia for an inspiration, then she came\nhere—this must on no account get round. And so cheerful through it all!\nI cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone,\neven if you do not approve of them.”"

She thought they were commercial travellers—‘drummers’ was the\nword she used—and all through dinner she tried to prove that England,\nour great and beloved country, rests on nothing but commerce. Teresa was\nvery much annoyed, and left the table before the cheese, saying as she\ndid so: ‘There, Miss Lavish, is one who can confute you better than I,’\nand pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson. Then Miss\nLavish said: ‘Tut! The early Victorians.’ Just imagine! ‘Tut! The early\nVictorians.’ My sister had gone, and I felt bound to speak. I said:\n‘Miss Lavish, I am an early Victorian; at least, that is to say, I\nwill hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen.’ It was horrible\nspeaking. I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did\nnot want to go, and I must say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply.\nBut, unluckily, Mr. Emerson overheard this part, and called in his deep\nvoice: ‘Quite so, quite so! I honour the woman for her Irish visit.’ The\nwoman! I tell things so badly; but you see what a tangle we were in\nby this time, all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first\nplace. But that was not all. After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up\nand said: ‘Miss Alan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those\ntwo nice men. Come, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable\ninvitation, and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would\nbroaden my ideas, and said that she had four brothers, all University\nmen, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking\nto commercial travellers.”"

They had been stopped at the Dazio\ncoming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and\ndesoeuvre, had tried to search their reticules for provisions.

This solitude oppressed her; she was\naccustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events,\ncontradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking\nright or wrong."

Charlotte declined for\nherself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon.

A Radical out and out, she learnt to\nspeak with horror of Suburbia. Life, so far as she troubled to conceive\nit, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and\nidentical foes. In this circle, one thought, married, and died. Outside\nit were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the\nLondon fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in\nthe northern hills. But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm\nhimself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.\nHer senses expanded; she felt that there was no one whom she might not\nget to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not\nparticularly high. You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant’s\nolive-yard in the Apennines, and he is glad to see you. She returned\nwith new eyes."

He did not realize that\nLucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities\nthat create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its\ndefects, her heart refused to despise it entirely. Nor did he realize\na more important point—that if she was too great for this society, she\nwas too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal\nintercourse would alone satisfy her. A rebel she was, but not of the\nkind he understood—a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but\nequality beside the man she loved.

When she talked to\nGeorge—they met again almost immediately at the Rectory—his voice\nmoved her deeply, and she wished to remain near him. How dreadful if she\nreally wished to remain near him! Of course, the wish was due to nerves,\nwhich love to play such perverse tricks upon us.
