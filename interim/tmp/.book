She promised us south rooms with a view close together, instead\nof which here are north rooms, looking into a courtyard, and a long way\napart. Oh, Lucy!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by\nthe Signora’s unexpected accent. “It might be London.” She looked at the\ntwo rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the row\nof white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that</p>",
  "page-11": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">ran between the\nEnglish people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet\nLaureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at the\nnotice of the English church (Rev. Cuthbert Eager, M. A. Oxon.), that\nwas the only other decoration of the wall. “Charlotte, don’t you feel,\ntoo, that we might be in London? I can hardly believe that all kinds of\nother things are just outside. I suppose it is one’s being so tired.”</p><p>“This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying\ndown her fork.</p><p>“I want so to see the Arno. The rooms the Signora promised us in her\nletter would have looked over the Arno. The Signora had no business to\ndo it at all. Oh, it is a shame!”</p><p>“Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard\nthat you shouldn’t have a view.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lucy felt that she had been selfish. “Charlotte, you</p>",
  "page-12": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">mustn’t spoil me:\nof course, you must look over the Arno, too. I meant that. The first\nvacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part\nof whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of\ngenerosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.</p><p>“No, no. You must have it.”</p><p>“I insist on it. Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.”</p><p>“She would never forgive me.”</p><p>The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a\nlittle peevish. They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness\nthey wrangled. Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one\nof them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant\nforward over the table and actually intruded into their argument. He\nsaid:</p><p>“I have a view, I have a view.”</p>",
  "page-13": "<p>Miss Bartlett was startled. Generally at a pension people looked them\nover for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that\nthey would “do” till they had gone. She knew that the intruder was\nill-bred, even before she glanced at him. He was an old man, of heavy\nbuild, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes. There was something\nchildish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.\nWhat exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her\nglance passed on to his clothes. These did not attract her. He was\nprobably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the\nswim. So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then\nsaid: “A view? Oh, a view! How delightful a view is!”</p><p>“This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George. He has a view\ntoo.”</p><p>“Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.</p>",
  "page-14": "<p>“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll\nhave yours. We’ll change.”</p><p>The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with\nthe new-comers. Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little\nas possible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the\nquestion.”</p><p>“Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.</p><p>“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.”</p><p>“You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy. Her cousin again\nrepressed her.</p><p>“But why?” he persisted. “Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And\nhe thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son,\nsaying, “George, persuade them!”</p><p>“It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son. “There’s\nnothing else to say.”</p>",
  "page-15": "<p>He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed\nand sorrowful. Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in\nfor what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that\nwhenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened\ntill it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something\nquite different, whose existence she had not realized before. Now the\nold man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not\nchange? What possible objection had she? They would clear out in half an\nhour.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was\npowerless in the presence of brutality. It was impossible to snub any\none so gross. Her face reddened with displeasure. She looked around as\nmuch as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who\nwere sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs\nof the chairs, looked</p>",
  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are\ngenteel.”</p><p>“Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with\nthe meat that she had once censured.</p><p>Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.</p><p>“Eat your dinner, dear. This pension is a failure. To-morrow we will\nmake a change.”</p><p>Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it. The\ncurtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout\nbut attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table,\ncheerfully apologizing for his lateness. Lucy, who had not yet acquired\ndecency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh! Why, it’s\nMr. Beebe! Oh, how perfectly lovely! Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now,\nhowever bad the rooms are. Oh!”</p><p>Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“How do you do, Mr. Beebe? I expect that you have</p>",
  "page-17": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">forgotten us: Miss\nBartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you\nhelped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.”</p><p>The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember\nthe ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him. But he came forward\npleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by\nLucy.</p><p>“I AM so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of\nspiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if\nher cousin had permitted it. “Just fancy how small the world is. Summer\nStreet, too, makes it so specially funny.”</p><p>“Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss\nBartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the course\nof conversation that you have just accepted the living—”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Yes, I heard from mother so last week. She didn’t</p>",
  "page-18": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">know that I knew you\nat Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr. Beebe\nis—’”</p><p>“Quite right,” said the clergyman. “I move into the Rectory at Summer\nStreet next June. I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming\nneighbourhood.”</p><p>“Oh, how glad I am! The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe\nbowed.</p><p>“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not often\nwe get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.”</p><p>“Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.”</p><p>“I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than\nto Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons. He asked the girl\nwhether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length that she\nhad never been there before. It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and\nhe was first in the</p>",
  "page-19": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">field. “Don’t neglect the country round,” his advice\nconcluded. “The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole, and round by\nSettignano, or something of that sort.”</p><p>“No!” cried a voice from the top of the table. “Mr. Beebe, you are\nwrong. The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.”</p><p>“That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin. “We\nare in luck.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them. People told\nthem what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to\nget rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how\nmuch the place would grow upon them. The Pension Bertolini had decided,\nalmost enthusiastically, that they would do. Whichever way they looked,\nkind ladies smiled and shouted at them. And above all rose the voice of\nthe clever lady, crying: “Prato! They must go to</p>",
  "page-20": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Prato. That place is\ntoo sweetly squalid for words. I love it; I revel in shaking off the\ntrammels of respectability, as you know.”</p><p>The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then returned\nmoodily to his plate. Obviously he and his father did not do. Lucy, in\nthe midst of her success, found time to wish they did. It gave her no\nextra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when she\nrose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little\nbow.</p><p>The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow,\nbut by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across\nsomething.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the\ncurtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with\nmore than cloth. Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing\ngood-evening to her guests, and supported by</p>",
  "page-21": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">‘Enery, her little boy, and\nVictorier, her daughter. It made a curious little scene, this attempt\nof the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South. And even\nmore curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival the solid\ncomfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house. Was this really Italy?</p><p>Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which\nhad the colour and the contours of a tomato. She was talking to Mr.\nBeebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and\nforwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some\ninvisible obstacle. “We are most grateful to you,” she was saying.\n“The first evening means so much. When you arrived we were in for a\npeculiarly mauvais quart d’heure.”</p><p>He expressed his regret.</p><p>“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us\nat dinner?”</p>",
  "page-22": "<p>“Emerson.”</p><p>“Is he a friend of yours?”</p><p>“We are friendly—as one is in pensions.”</p><p>“Then I will say no more.”</p><p>He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.</p><p>“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin,\nLucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation\nto people of whom we know nothing. His manner was somewhat unfortunate.\nI hope I acted for the best.”</p><p>“You acted very naturally,” said he. He seemed thoughtful, and after\na few moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have\ncome of accepting.”</p><p>“No harm, of course. But we could not be under an obligation.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said gently:\n“I think he would not take</p>",
  "page-23": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">advantage of your acceptance, nor expect you\nto show gratitude. He has the merit—if it is one—of saying exactly\nwhat he means. He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks you would\nvalue them. He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than\nhe thought of being polite. It is so difficult—at least, I find it\ndifficult—to understand people who speak the truth.”</p><p>Lucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so\nalways hope that people will be nice.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I think he is; nice and tiresome. I differ from him on almost every\npoint of any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will\ndiffer. But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores. When\nhe first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up. He has no\ntact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and\nhe will not keep his opinions to himself. We nearly complained about\nhim</p>",
  "page-24": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of\nit.”</p><p>“Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?”</p><p>Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching\nof the lips.</p><p>“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?”</p><p>“I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet. He seems a nice\ncreature, and I think he has brains. Of course, he has all his father’s\nmannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a Socialist.”</p><p>“Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett. “So you think I ought to\nhave accepted their offer? You feel I have been narrow-minded and\nsuspicious?”</p><p>“Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.”</p><p>“But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent rudeness?”</p>",
  "page-25": "<p>He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary,\nand got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.</p><p>“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared. “Why\ndidn’t you talk, Lucy? He prefers young people, I’m sure. I do hope I\nhaven’t monopolized him. I hoped you would have him all the evening, as\nwell as all dinner-time.”</p><p>“He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy. “Just what I remember. He seems to see\ngood in everyone. No one would take him for a clergyman.”</p><p>“My dear Lucia—”</p><p>“Well, you know what I mean. And you know how clergymen generally laugh;\nMr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.”</p><p>“Funny girl! How you do remind me of your mother. I wonder if she will\napprove of Mr. Beebe.”</p><p>“I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.”</p>",
  "page-26": "<p>“I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable\nworld. I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind\nthe times.”</p><p>“Yes,” said Lucy despondently.</p><p>There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval\nwas of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy\nCorner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not\ndetermine. She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered. Miss\nBartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am\nafraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.”</p><p>And the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must\nbe more careful. It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been\nsmiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed\nto sit where Mr.</p>",
  "page-27": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Beebe had sat. Permission granted, she began to chatter\ngently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the gratifying\nsuccess of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s health, the\nnecessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of thoroughly\nemptying the water-bottles in the morning. She handled her subjects\nagreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention than\nthe high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was proceeding\ntempestuously at the other end of the room. It was a real catastrophe,\nnot a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when she had found\nin her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one\nbetter than something else.</p><p>“But here you are as safe as in England. Signora Bertolini is so\nEnglish.”</p><p>“Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy. “We dread going to bed.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed. “If</p>",
  "page-28": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">only Mr. Emerson was\nmore tactful! We were so sorry for you at dinner.”</p><p>“I think he was meaning to be kind.”</p><p>“Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.</p><p>“Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature. Of\ncourse, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.”</p><p>“Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could\nnot be too careful with a young girl.</p><p>Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool. No\none was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not noticed\nit.</p><p>“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know. No, he is not tactful; yet, have\nyou ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most\nindelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word.</p>",
  "page-29": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">“Are not beauty\nand delicacy the same?”</p><p>“So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly. “But things are\nso difficult, I sometimes think.”</p><p>She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking\nextremely pleasant.</p><p>“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms. I’m so glad.\nMr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what\nI did, I encouraged him to make the offer again. He has let me come and\nask you. He would be so pleased.”</p><p>“Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.\nThe old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.”</p><p>Miss Bartlett was silent.</p><p>“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious. I\nmust apologize for my interference.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Gravely displeased, he turned to go. Not till then did</p>",
  "page-30": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Miss Bartlett\nreply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with\nyours. It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at\nFlorence, when I am only here through your kindness. If you wish me to\nturn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it. Would you then,\nMr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and\nthen conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?”</p><p>She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the\ndrawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines. The\nclergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with her\nmessage.</p><p>“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this. I do not wish the\nacceptance to come from you. Grant me that, at all events.”</p><p>Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Mr. Emerson is engaged, but here is his son</p>",
  "page-31": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">instead.”</p><p>The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the\nfloor, so low were their chairs.</p><p>“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him\npersonally. But any message given by you to me will be given by me to\nhim as soon as he comes out.”</p><p>Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath. All her barbed civilities came\nforth wrong end first. Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to the\ndelight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.</p><p>“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.</p><p>“How angry he is with his father about the rooms! It is all he can do to\nkeep polite.”</p><p>“In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe. Then\nlooking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own\nrooms, to write up his philosophic diary.</p>",
  "page-32": "<p>“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the\nwinds of heaven had entered the apartment. “Gentlemen sometimes do not\nrealize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand\nand a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly\nrealize played a principal part. Lucy, not realizing either, was reduced\nto literature. Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy, she\ncommitted to memory the most important dates of Florentine History. For\nshe was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow. Thus the half-hour\ncrept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a sigh, and\nsaid:</p><p>“I think one might venture now. No, Lucy, do not stir. I will\nsuperintend the move.”</p><p>“How you do do everything,” said Lucy.</p><p>“Naturally, dear. It is my affair.”</p><p>“But I would like to help you.”</p>",
  "page-33": "<p>“No, dear.”</p><p>Charlotte’s energy! And her unselfishness! She had been thus all her\nlife, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself. So\nLucy felt, or strove to feel. And yet—there was a rebellious spirit\nin her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less\ndelicate and more beautiful. At all events, she entered her own room\nwithout any feeling of joy.</p><p>“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken\nthe largest room. Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you;\nbut I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure\nyour mother would not like it.”</p><p>Lucy was bewildered.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under\nan obligation to his father than to him.

  "page-34": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">a\nguarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.”</p><p>“Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of\nlarger and unsuspected issues.</p><p>Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as\nshe wished her good-night. It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when\nshe reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean\nnight air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the\nlights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the\nfoot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the\ndoor, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards\nled, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances. It was\nthen that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on\nwhich was scrawled an enormous note</p>",
  "page-35": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of interrogation. Nothing more.</p><p>“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the\nlight of a candle. Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing,\nobnoxious, portentous with evil. She was seized with an impulse to\ndestroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so,\nsince it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson. So she unpinned it\ncarefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it\nclean for him. Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed\nheavily according to her habit, and went to bed.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

It was pleasant, too, to\nfling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings,\nto lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble\nchurches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling</p>",

Children tried to\nhang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their faces\nto make them let go. Then soldiers appeared—good-looking, undersized\nmen—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a great-coat\nwhich had been cut for some larger soldier. Beside them walked officers,\nlooking foolish and fierce, and before them went little boys, turning\nsomersaults in time with the band.

By the time Lucy was ready her cousin\nhad done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the\ncrumbs.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines.

  "page-39": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Lucy would at all like to go out? Lucy would\nrather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but, of\ncourse, she could go alone.

Oh, yes!</p><p>At this point the clever lady broke in.</p><p>“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you\ncan neglect the good person. Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be\nperfectly safe. Italians understand. A dear friend of mine, Contessa\nBaroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to school\nwith them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead.

She was determined to</p>",
  "page-40": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">take Lucy herself, her head not being\nso very bad. The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a\nlong morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be\ndelighted.</p><p>“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you\nbring me luck, we shall have an adventure.”</p><p>Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to\nsee where Santa Croce was.</p><p>“Tut, tut! Miss Lucy! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker.\nHe does but touch the surface of things. As to the true Italy—he does\nnot even dream of it. The true Italy is only to be found by patient\nobservation.”</p><p>This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and\nstarted with her new friend in high spirits. Italy was coming at last.\nThe Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.</p>",
  "page-41": "<p>Miss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right\nalong the sunny Lung’ Arno. How delightfully warm! But a wind down\nthe side streets cut like a knife, didn’t it?

Then\nMiss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she\nstopped, and she cried:</p><p>“A smell! a true Florentine smell! Every city, let me teach you, has its\nown smell.”</p><p>“Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother\na distaste to dirt.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes for\nlife. Buon giorno! Buon giorno!” bowing right and left. “Look at that\nadorable wine-cart!</p>",
  "page-42": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">How the driver stares at us, dear, simple soul!”</p><p>So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence,\nshort, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s\ngrace. It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so\ncheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears,\nonly increased the sense of festivity.</p><p>“Buon giorno! Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will\nnever repent of a little civility to your inferiors. That is the\ntrue democracy. Though I am a real Radical as well. There, now you’re\nshocked.”</p><p>“Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy. “We are Radicals, too, out and out.\nMy father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful about\nIreland.”</p><p>“I see, I see. And now you have gone over to the enemy.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Oh, please—! If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical\nagain now that Ireland is all right.</p>",
  "page-43": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">And as it is, the glass over our\nfront door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the\nTories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.”</p><p>“Shameful! A manufacturing district, I suppose?”</p><p>“No—in the Surrey hills. About five miles from Dorking, looking over\nthe Weald.”</p><p>Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.</p><p>“What a delightful part; I know it so well. It is full of the very\nnicest people. Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there\nwas?”</p><p>“Very well indeed.”</p><p>“And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?”</p><p>“Why, she rents a field of us! How funny!”</p><p>Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you\nhave property in Surrey?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob. “Only thirty\nacres—just the garden, all downhill,</p>",
  "page-44": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and some fields.”</p><p>Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her\naunt’s Suffolk estate. Italy receded. They tried to remember the last\nname of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street\nthe other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her. And just\nas Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed:</p><p>“Bless us! Bless us and save us! We’ve lost the way.”</p><p>Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the tower\nof which had been plainly visible from the landing window. But Miss\nLavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that Lucy\nhad followed her with no misgivings.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Lost! lost! My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have\ntaken a wrong turning. How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!\nWhat are we to do? Two lone females in an unknown town. Now, this</p>",
  "page-45": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">is\nwhat I call an adventure.”</p><p>Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution,\nthat they should ask the way there.</p><p>“Oh, but that is the word of a craven! And no, you are not, not, NOT to\nlook at your Baedeker. Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it. We will\nsimply drift.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets,\nneither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the\ncity abounds. Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady\nLouisa, and became discontented herself. For one ravishing moment Italy\nappeared. She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the\nliving terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can\never stale. There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from\nthe garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against\ncirclets of heaven. Lucy thought she had never seen anything</p>",
  "page-46": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">more\nbeautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her\nforward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a\nmile.</p><p>The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or\nrather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste\nout of a little shop, because it looked so typical. It tasted partly\nof the paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the\ngreat unknown. But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza,\nlarge and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white\nfacade of surpassing ugliness. Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically. It\nwas Santa Croce. The adventure was over.</p><p>“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to\nthem. I do detest conventional intercourse. Nasty! they are going into\nthe church, too. Oh, the Britisher abroad!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“We sat opposite them at dinner last night. They</p>",
  "page-47": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">have given us their\nrooms. They were so very kind.”</p><p>“Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish. “They walk through my\nItaly like a pair of cows. It’s very naughty of me, but I would like\nto set an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who\ncouldn’t pass it.”</p><p>“What would you ask us?”</p><p>Miss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest\nthat she, at all events, would get full marks. In this exalted mood they\nreached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it when\nMiss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried:</p><p>“There goes my local-colour box! I must have a word with him!”</p><p>And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak\nflapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an\nold man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.</p>",
  "page-48": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes. Then she began to get tired. The\nbeggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that\na young girl ought not to loiter in public places. She descended slowly\ninto the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was\nreally almost too original. But at that moment Miss Lavish and her\nlocal-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both\ngesticulating largely. Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly\nbecause Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her\nBaedeker. How could she find her way home? How could she find her way\nabout in Santa Croce? Her first morning was ruined, and she might never\nbe in Florence again. A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits,\ntalking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she\nwas full of originality. Now she entered the church depressed and\nhumiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by</p>",
  "page-49": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the\nFranciscans or the Dominicans. Of course, it must be a wonderful\nbuilding. But how like a barn! And how very cold! Of course, it\ncontained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values\nshe was capable of feeling what was proper. But who was to tell\nher which they were? She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be\nenthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date. There was\nno one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved\nthe nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one\nthat had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of\nacquiring information, she began to be happy. She puzzled out the\nItalian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into\nthe church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and\nout of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves,\nnot to spit. She watched the tourists;</p>",
  "page-50": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">their noses were as red as their\nBaedekers, so cold was Santa Croce. She beheld the horrible fate that\novertook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their\ncareer by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to\nthe Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed. Advancing towards it\nvery slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with\ntheir fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then\nretreated. What could this mean? They did it again and again. Then Lucy\nrealized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping\nto acquire virtue. Punishment followed quickly. The smallest he-baby\nstumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr. Ruskin,\nand entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop. Protestant\nas she was, Lucy darted forward. She was too late. He fell heavily upon\nthe prelate’s upturned toes.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr.</p>",
  "page-51": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Emerson, who had darted\nforward also. “Hard in life, hard in death. Go out into the sunshine,\nlittle boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where you ought\nto be. Intolerable bishop!”</p><p>The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful\npeople who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him\nnot to be superstitious.</p><p>“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy. “Here’s a mess: a baby hurt,\ncold, and frightened! But what else can you expect from a church?”</p><p>The child’s legs had become as melting wax. Each time that old Mr.\nEmerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar. Fortunately an\nItalian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the\nrescue. By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she\nstiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his knees.\nHe stood. Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.</p>",
  "page-52": "<p>“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson. “You have done more than\nall the relics in the world. I am not of your creed, but I do believe in\nthose who make their fellow-creatures happy. There is no scheme of the\nuniverse—”</p><p>He paused for a phrase.</p><p>“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.</p><p>“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.</p><p>In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons. She was\ndetermined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate,\nand, if possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious\nreference to the pleasant rooms.</p><p>“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply. “But what\nare you doing here? Are you doing the church? Are you through with the\nchurch?”</p>",
  "page-53": "<p>“No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance. “I came here with Miss\nLavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too\nbad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come\nin by myself.”</p><p>“Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.</p><p>“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the\nyoung lady for the first time.</p><p>“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.”</p><p>“Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson. “I’m glad it’s THAT you minded. It’s worth\nminding, the loss of a Baedeker. THAT’S worth minding.”</p><p>Lucy was puzzled. She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not\nsure whither it would lead her.</p><p>“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this\nwhere the idea would lead? She took refuge in her dignity.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Thank you very much, but I could not think of</p>",
  "page-54": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that. I hope you do not\nsuppose that I came to join on to you. I really came to help with the\nchild, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night. I\nhope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.”</p><p>“My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating what\nyou have heard older people say. You are pretending to be touchy; but\nyou are not really. Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead what\npart of the church you want to see. To take you to it will be a real\npleasure.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been\nfurious. But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it\nis difficult at other times to keep it. Lucy could not get cross. Mr.\nEmerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him. On the other\nhand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to be\noffended with him, or at all</p>",
  "page-55": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">events be offended before him. It was at\nhim that she gazed before replying.</p><p>“I am not touchy, I hope. It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you\nwill kindly tell me which they are.”</p><p>The son nodded. With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to\nthe Peruzzi Chapel. There was a hint of the teacher about him. She felt\nlike a child in school who had answered a question rightly.</p><p>The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of\nthem rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship Giotto,\nnot by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce;\nhow it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before\nany taint of the Renaissance had appeared. Observe how Giotto in these\nfrescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the\nsnares of anatomy and perspective.</p>",
  "page-56": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Could anything be more majestic, more\npathetic, beautiful, true? How little, we feel, avails knowledge and\ntechnical cleverness against a man who truly feels!”</p><p>“No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.\n“Remember nothing of the sort! Built by faith indeed! That simply means\nthe workmen weren’t paid properly. And as for the frescoes, I see no\ntruth in them. Look at that fat man in blue! He must weigh as much as I\ndo, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.”</p><p>He was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside,\nthe lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might. The audience shifted\nuneasily, and so did Lucy. She was sure that she ought not to be with\nthese men; but they had cast a spell over her. They were so serious and\nso strange that she could not remember how to behave.</p><p>“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it? Yes or no?”</p>",
  "page-57": "<p>George replied:</p><p>“It happened like this, if it happened at all. I would rather go up to\nheaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should\nlike my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.”</p><p>“You will never go up,” said his father. “You and I, dear boy, will\nlie at peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as\nsurely as our work survives.”</p><p>“Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint, whoever\nhe is, going up. It did happen like that, if it happened at all.”</p><p>“Pardon me,” said a frigid voice. “The chapel is somewhat small for two\nparties. We will incommode you no longer.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock,\nfor they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands. They\nfiled out of the chapel</p>",
  "page-58": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">in silence. Amongst them were the two little old\nladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine Alan.</p><p>“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson. “There’s plenty of room for us all. Stop!”</p><p>The procession disappeared without a word.</p><p>Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the life\nof St. Francis.</p><p>“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.”</p><p>George went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is. I\ndon’t remember.”</p><p>“Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am. It’s that Mr.\nEager. Why did he go? Did we talk too loud? How vexatious. I shall go\nand say we are sorry.

  "page-59": "<p>But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the\nRev. Cuthbert Eager. Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear\nthe lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old\nman, the curt, injured replies of his opponent. The son, who took every\nlittle contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.</p><p>“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her. “He\nwill try to be kind.”</p><p>“I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.</p><p>“Because we think it improves our characters. But he is kind to people\nbecause he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or\nfrightened.”</p><p>“How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I\nthink that a kind action done tactfully—”</p><p>“Tact!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He threw up his head in disdain. Apparently she had</p>",
  "page-60": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">given the wrong\nanswer. She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.\nFor a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon\nit—hard. Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness. She saw him once again\nat Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of\nacorns. Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness,\nof tragedy that might only find solution in the night. The feeling soon\npassed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle. Born\nof silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned,\nand she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone familiar\nto her.</p><p>“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.</p><p>“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people. They\nwon’t come back.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in\nothers...vision of the brotherhood of man...”</p>",
  "page-61": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Scraps of the lecture on\nSt. Francis came floating round the partition wall.</p><p>“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy. “Have you looked at\nthose saints?”</p><p>“Yes,” said Lucy. “They are lovely.

George,\nrather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man wandered\nnot unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a barn,\nhas harvested many beautiful things inside its walls. There were also\nbeggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old lady\nwith her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his\nMass through the groups of tourists. But Mr. Emerson was only half\ninterested. He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had\nimpaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.</p>",
  "page-62": "<p>“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily. “I saw nothing in\nit.”</p><p>“I like Giotto,” she replied. “It is so wonderful what they say about\nhis tactile values.

And my baby’s worth the\nwhole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.”</p><p>Lucy again felt that this did not do.</p><p>“In Hell,” he repeated. “He’s unhappy.”</p><p>“Oh, dear!” said Lucy.</p><p>“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive?

She loved going to\nconcerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee and\nmeringues. He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also. But before\nhe left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he now\nmade to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano</p>",
  "page-73": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and moved dreamily\ntowards him:</p><p>“If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very\nexciting both for us and for her.”</p><p>Lucy at once re-entered daily life.</p><p>“Oh, what a funny thing! Some one said just the same to mother, and she\nsaid she trusted I should never live a duet.”</p><p>“Doesn’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music?”</p><p>“She doesn’t mind it. But she doesn’t like one to get excited over\nanything; she thinks I am silly about it. She thinks—I can’t make\nout. Once, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any\none’s. She has never got over it. Of course, I didn’t mean that I played\nwell; I only meant—”</p><p>“Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Music—” said Lucy, as if attempting some generality. She could not\ncomplete it, and looked out</p>",
  "page-74": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">absently upon Italy in the wet. The whole\nlife of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in\nEurope had turned into formless lumps of clothes.</p><p>The street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey,\nand the hills were dirty purple. Somewhere in their folds were concealed\nMiss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon to visit\nthe Torre del Gallo.</p><p>“What about music?” said Mr. Beebe.</p><p>“Poor Charlotte will be sopped,” was Lucy’s reply.</p><p>The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold,\ntired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and\na tickling cough in her throat. On another day, when the whole world was\nsinging and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse to\nstir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no fit\ncompanion for a hearty girl.</p>",
  "page-75": "<p>“Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray. She hopes to find the true\nItaly in the wet I believe.”</p><p>“Miss Lavish is so original,” murmured Lucy. This was a stock remark,\nthe supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of\ndefinition. Miss Lavish was so original. Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but\nthey would have been put down to clerical narrowness. For that, and for\nother reasons, he held his peace.</p><p>“Is it true,” continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, “that Miss Lavish is\nwriting a book?”</p><p>“They do say so.”</p><p>“What is it about?”</p><p>“It will be a novel,” replied Mr. Beebe, “dealing with modern Italy.\nLet me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words\nherself more admirably than any one I know.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself.

They were always in each\nother’s company, with Lucy a slighted third. Miss Lavish he believed\nhe understood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of\nstrangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning. Was Italy deflecting\nher from the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at\nTunbridge Wells? All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies;\nthey were his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample\nopportunities for the work. Girls like Lucy were charming to look at,\nbut Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in</p>",
  "page-77": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">his\nattitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather\nthan enthralled.</p><p>Lucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped. The\nArno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts\nupon the foreshore. But in the south-west there had appeared a dull haze\nof yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse. She\nopened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the room, drawing\na plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at the same moment\nby the door.</p><p>“Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill! And Mr. Beebe here\nbesides. Who would suppose this is Italy? There is my sister actually\nnursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.”</p><p>She sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was\non entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.</p>",
  "page-78": "<p>“I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in\nmy room with the door shut. Doors shut; indeed, most necessary. No one\nhas the least idea of privacy in this country. And one person catches it\nfrom another.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lucy answered suitably. Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of\nhis adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his\nbath, exclaiming cheerfully, “Fa niente, sono vecchia.” He contented\nhimself with saying: “I quite agree with you, Miss Alan. The Italians\nare a most unpleasant people. They pry everywhere, they see everything,\nand they know what we want before we know it ourselves. We are at their\nmercy. They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires. From the\ncab-driver down to—to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent\nit. Yet in their heart of hearts they are—how superficial! They have no\nconception of the intellectual life. How right is Signora Bertolini,</p>",

Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe, having\nexpected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who\nwore a pair of russet whiskers.

  "page-80": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">awe and mirth. “Indeed,\nthough it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as\nyou suppose. She took to it, practically in despair, after her\nlife’s work was carried away in a landslip. Surely that makes it more\nexcusable.”</p><p>“What was that?” asked Lucy.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: “It was\na novel—and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice novel.\nIt is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I must say\nthey nearly always do. Anyhow, she left it almost finished in the Grotto\nof the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a\nlittle ink. She said: ‘Can I have a little ink, please?’ But you know\nwhat Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the\nbeach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she\nhas written.

Then Miss\nLavish said: ‘Tut! The early Victorians.’ Just imagine! ‘Tut! The early\nVictorians.’ My sister had gone, and I felt bound to speak. I said:\n‘Miss Lavish, I am an early Victorian; at least, that is to say, I\nwill hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen.’ It was horrible\nspeaking. I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did\nnot want to go, and I must say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply.\nBut, unluckily, Mr. Emerson overheard this part, and called in his</p>",

After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up\nand said: ‘Miss Alan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those\ntwo nice men. Come, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable\ninvitation, and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would\nbroaden my ideas, and said that she had four brothers, all University\nmen, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking\nto commercial travellers.”</p><p>“Let me finish the story,” said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said:\n‘I shall go alone.’ She went.

Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do not\nmind him. Miss Alan, what do you think? Is he nice?”</p><p>The little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly.

Miss Bartlett, smarting\nunder an obligation, would scarcely be civil. The case of Lucy was\ndifferent.

Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god,\nhalf ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who\nidled together on its marge. The Loggia showed as the triple entrance of\na cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth\nupon the arrivals and departures of mankind. It was the hour of\nunreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real.

  "page-99": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to her,\n“Oh, what have I done?”—the thought that she, as well as the dying man,\nhad crossed some spiritual boundary.</p><p>He returned, and she talked of the murder.

But he lacked chivalry; his thoughts,\nlike his behaviour, would not be modified by awe. It was useless to say\nto him, “And would you—” and hope that he would complete the sentence\nfor himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in\nthat beautiful picture. She had been in his arms, and he remembered it,\njust as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought\nin Alinari’s shop.

She and Miss\nLavish had had an adventure also. They had been stopped at the Dazio\ncoming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and\ndesoeuvre, had tried to search their reticules for</p>",
  "page-106": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">provisions. It might\nhave been most unpleasant. Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match for any\none.</p><p>For good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone. None\nof her friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by\nthe embankment. Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at\ndinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of “Too much\nBeethoven.” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure,\nnot that she had encountered it. This solitude oppressed her; she was\naccustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events,\ncontradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking\nright or wrong.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At breakfast next morning she took decisive action. There were two plans\nbetween which she had to choose. Mr. Beebe was walking up to the\nTorre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies. Would Miss\nBartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party?</p>",
  "page-107": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Charlotte declined for\nherself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon. But\nshe thought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing\nmoney, fetching letters, and other irksome duties—all of which Miss\nBartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.</p><p>“No, Charlotte!” cried the girl, with real warmth. “It’s very kind of\nMr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you. I had much rather.”</p><p>“Very well, dear,” said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure\nthat called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy. How\nabominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always! But now she should\nalter. All morning she would be really nice to her.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She slipped her arm into her cousin’s, and they started off along the\nLung’ Arno. The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and\ncolour. Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at\nit.</p>",
  "page-108": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">She then made her usual remark, which was “How I do wish Freddy and\nyour mother could see this, too!”</p><p>Lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly\nwhere she did.</p><p>“Look, Lucia! Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party. I\nfeared you would repent you of your choice.”</p><p>Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent. Yesterday had been\na muddle—queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down\neasily on paper—but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping\nwere preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del\nGallo. Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not\nto re-enter it. She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett’s\ninsinuations.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately\nremained. Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the\nriver to the Piazza</p>",
  "page-109": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Signoria. She could not have believed that stones, a\nLoggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance. For a\nmoment she understood the nature of ghosts.</p><p>The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss\nLavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand. She hailed them\nbriskly. The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an\nidea which she thought would work up into a book.</p><p>“Oh, let me congratulate you!” said Miss Bartlett. “After your despair\nof yesterday! What a fortunate thing!”</p><p>“Aha! Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck. Now, you are to tell\nme absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.” Lucy poked at\nthe ground with her parasol.</p><p>“But perhaps you would rather not?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I’m sorry—if you could manage without it, I think</p>",
  "page-110": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">I would rather not.”</p><p>The elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable\nthat a girl should feel deeply.</p><p>“It is I who am sorry,” said Miss Lavish “literary hacks are shameless\ncreatures. I believe there’s no secret of the human heart into which we\nwouldn’t pry.”</p><p>She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few\ncalculations in realism. Then she said that she had been in the\nPiazza since eight o’clock collecting material. A good deal of it was\nunsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt. The two men had\nquarrelled over a five-franc note. For the five-franc note she should\nsubstitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and\nat the same time furnish an excellent plot.</p><p>“What is the heroine’s name?” asked Miss Bartlett.</p><p>“Leonora,” said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.</p>",
  "page-111": "<p>“I do hope she’s nice.”</p><p>That desideratum would not be omitted.</p><p>“And what is the plot?”</p><p>Love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot. But it all came while\nthe fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.</p><p>“I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,” Miss Lavish\nconcluded. “It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people.\nOf course, this is the barest outline. There will be a deal of local\ncolouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall\nalso introduce some humorous characters. And let me give you all fair\nwarning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.”</p><p>“Oh, you wicked woman,” cried Miss Bartlett. “I am sure you are thinking\nof the Emersons.”</p><p>Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with</p>",
  "page-112": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">my own countrymen.\nIt is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going\nto paint so far as I can. For I repeat and I insist, and I have always\nheld most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday’s is not the less\ntragic because it happened in humble life.”</p><p>There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded. Then the\ncousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across the\nsquare.</p><p>“She is my idea of a really clever woman,” said Miss Bartlett. “That\nlast remark struck me as so particularly true. It should be a most\npathetic novel.”</p><p>Lucy assented. At present her great aim was not to get put into it. Her\nperceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that Miss\nLavish had her on trial for an ingenue.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,”\n continued Miss Bartlett slowly. “None but the superficial would be\nshocked at her. We had a</p>",
  "page-113": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">long talk yesterday. She believes in justice\nand truth and human interest. She told me also that she has a high\nopinion of the destiny of woman—Mr. Eager! Why, how nice! What a\npleasant surprise!”</p><p>“Ah, not for me,” said the chaplain blandly, “for I have been watching\nyou and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.”</p><p>“We were chatting to Miss Lavish.”</p><p>His brow contracted.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“So I saw. Were you indeed? Andate via! sono occupato!” The last remark\nwas made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a\ncourteous smile. “I am about to venture a suggestion. Would you and\nMiss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week—a\ndrive in the hills? We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.\nThere is a point on that road where we could get down and have an\nhour’s ramble on the hillside. The view</p>",
  "page-114": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">thence of Florence is most\nbeautiful—far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole.

Ah, the world is too much for us.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Miss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she knew\nthat Mr. Eager was no commonplace chaplain. He was a member of the\nresidential colony who had made Florence their home. He knew the people\nwho never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta\nafter lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of,\nand saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them. Living\nin delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in Renaissance\nvillas on Fiesole’s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and exchanged\nideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather perception,\nof</p>",
  "page-115": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the\ncoupons of Cook.</p><p>Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.\nBetween the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and it\nwas his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed\nworthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent. Tea\nat a Renaissance villa? Nothing had been said about it yet. But if it\ndid come to that—how Lucy would enjoy it!</p><p>A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same. But the joys of life\nwere grouping themselves anew. A drive in the hills with Mr. Eager and\nMiss Bartlett—even if culminating in a residential tea-party—was\nno longer the greatest of them. She echoed the raptures of Charlotte\nsomewhat faintly. Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming did\nher thanks become more sincere.</p>",

She can hardly bear to speak of it.”\n She glanced at Lucy proudly.</p><p>“And how came we to have you here?” asked the chaplain paternally.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Miss Bartlett’s recent liberalism oozed away at the</p>",
  "page-117": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">question. “Do\nnot blame her, please, Mr. Eager. The fault is mine: I left her\nunchaperoned.”</p><p>“So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?” His voice suggested\nsympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing\ndetails would not be unacceptable. His dark, handsome face drooped\nmournfully towards her to catch her reply.</p><p>“Practically.”</p><p>“One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,” said Miss\nBartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.</p><p>“For her also it must have been a terrible experience. I trust that\nneither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?”</p><p>Of the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable\nwas this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble\nafter blood. George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.</p>",
  "page-118": "<p>“He died by the fountain, I believe,” was her reply.</p><p>“And you and your friend—”</p><p>“Were over at the Loggia.”</p><p>“That must have saved you much. You have not, of course, seen the\ndisgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press—This man is a public\nnuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes\non worrying me to buy his vulgar views.”</p><p>Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy—in the eternal\nleague of Italy with youth. He had suddenly extended his book before\nMiss Bartlett and Mr. Eager, binding their hands together by a long\nglossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.</p><p>“This is too much!” cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of\nFra Angelico’s angels. She tore. A shrill cry rose from the vendor. The\nbook it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.</p><p>“Willingly would I purchase—” began Miss Bartlett.</p>",
  "page-119": "<p>“Ignore him,” said Mr. Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away\nfrom the square.</p><p>But an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a\ngrievance.

She had\nbeen a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr. Eager, she knew\nnot why. And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough, ceased\nto respect them. She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great artist. She\ndoubted that Mr. Eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she\nhad been led to suppose.

It was\nintolerable that she should disbelieve him.</p><p>“Murder, if you want to know,” he cried angrily. “That man murdered his\nwife!”</p><p>“How?” she retorted.</p>",
  "page-124": "<p>“To all intents and purposes he murdered her.

Oh, is our drive to come off?”</p><p>Lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the\ncomplacency of Mr. Eager was restored.</p><p>“Bother the drive!” exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed. “It\nis just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at\nall.

Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it,\nwas now impossible. Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about\nthem, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts.

She looked on the\nexpedition as the work of Fate. But for it she would have avoided George\nEmerson successfully. In an open manner he had shown that he wished to\ncontinue their intimacy. She had refused, not because she disliked him,\nbut because she did not know what had happened, and suspected that he\ndid know. And this frightened her.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">For the real event—whatever it was—had taken place, not in the Loggia,\nbut by the river. To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.\nBut to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence,\nand through silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled\nemotion, but of the whole fabric. There was really something blameworthy\n(she thought) in their</p>",
  "page-136": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">joint contemplation of the shadowy stream, in the\ncommon impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of\na look or word. This sense of wickedness had been slight at first. She\nhad nearly joined the party to the Torre del Gallo. But each time that\nshe avoided George it became more imperative that she should avoid\nhim again. And now celestial irony, working through her cousin and two\nclergymen, did not suffer her to leave Florence till she had made this\nexpedition with him through the hills.</p><p>Meanwhile Mr. Eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was\nover.</p><p>“So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling? As a student of art?”</p><p>“Oh, dear me, no—oh, no!”</p><p>“Perhaps as a student of human nature,” interposed Miss Lavish, “like\nmyself?”</p><p>“Oh, no. I am here as a tourist.”</p>",
  "page-137": "<p>“Oh, indeed,” said Mr. Eager. “Are you indeed? If you will not think me\nrude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed\nabout like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to\nRome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious\nof anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get ‘done’\nor ‘through’ and go on somewhere else. The result is, they mix up towns,\nrivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl. You know the American girl\nin Punch who says: ‘Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?’ And the father\nreplies: ‘Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog.’\nThere’s travelling for you. Ha! ha! ha!”</p><p>“I quite agree,” said Miss Lavish, who had several times tried to\ninterrupt his mordant wit. “The narrowness and superficiality of the\nAnglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Quite so. Now, the English colony at Florence,</p>",
  "page-138": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Miss Honeychurch—and it\nis of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally—a few are\nhere for trade, for example. But the greater part are students. Lady\nHelen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico. I mention her\nname because we are passing her villa on the left. No, you can only see\nit if you stand—no, do not stand; you will fall. She is very proud of\nthat thick hedge. Inside, perfect seclusion. One might have gone back\nsix hundred years. Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of\nThe Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?”</p><p>“It does indeed!” cried Miss Lavish. “Tell me, where do they place the\nscene of that wonderful seventh day?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But Mr. Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right lived\nMr. Someone Something, an American of the best type—so rare!—and that\nthe Somebody Elses were farther down the hill. “Doubtless you know\nher monographs in the series of ‘Mediaeval</p>",

Lucy had a spasm of envy. Granted that they wished\nto misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so. They were\nprobably the only people enjoying the expedition. The carriage swept\nwith agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the\nSettignano road.</p><p>“Piano! piano!” said Mr. Eager, elegantly waving his hand over his head.</p><p>“Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,” crooned the driver, and whipped\nhis horses up again.</p>",
  "page-140": "<p>Now Mr. Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the\nsubject of Alessio Baldovinetti. Was he a cause of the Renaissance, or\nwas he one of its manifestations? The other carriage was left behind.

Phaethon, who for some\ntime had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.</p><p>A little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was\nmost unpleasant. The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to\ndisentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his pourboire, the girl was\nimmediately to get down.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“She is my sister,” said he, turning round on them</p>",
  "page-141": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">with piteous eyes.</p><p>Mr. Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.</p><p>Phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but\nat its manner. At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping\nhad awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated, and\npatted them on the back to signify his approval. And Miss Lavish, though\nunwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of Bohemianism.</p><p>“Most certainly I would let them be,” she cried. “But I dare say I\nshall receive scant support. I have always flown in the face of the\nconventions all my life. This is what I call an adventure.”</p><p>“We must not submit,” said Mr. Eager. “I knew he was trying it on. He is\ntreating us as if we were a party of Cook’s tourists.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Surely no!” said Miss Lavish, her ardour visibly</p>",
  "page-142": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">decreasing.</p><p>The other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe\ncalled out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave\nthemselves properly.</p><p>“Leave them alone,” Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood\nin no awe. “Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the\nbox when it happens to sit there? To be driven by lovers—A king might\nenvy us, and if we part them it’s more like sacrilege than anything I\nknow.”</p><p>Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun\nto collect.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mr. Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a\nresolute will, was determined to make himself heard. He addressed the\ndriver again. Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream,\nwith unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony.\nIn Mr. Eager’s mouth it resembled nothing</p>",
  "page-143": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">so much as an acid whistling\nfountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker,\nand more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a click.</p><p>“Signorina!” said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased. Why\nshould he appeal to Lucy?</p><p>“Signorina!” echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto. She pointed at\nthe other carriage. Why?</p><p>For a moment the two girls looked at each other. Then Persephone got\ndown from the box.</p><p>“Victory at last!” said Mr. Eager, smiting his hands together as the\ncarriages started again.</p><p>“It is not victory,” said Mr. Emerson. “It is defeat. You have parted\ntwo people who were happy.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mr. Eager shut his eyes. He was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but\nhe would not speak to him. The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took\nup the matter warmly. He commanded Lucy to agree with him; he</p>",
  "page-144": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">shouted\nfor support to his son.</p><p>“We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money. He has bargained\nto drive us, and he is doing it. We have no rights over his soul.”</p><p>Miss Lavish frowned. It is hard when a person you have classed as\ntypically British speaks out of his character.</p><p>“He was not driving us well,” she said. “He jolted us.”</p><p>“That I deny. It was as restful as sleeping. Aha! he is jolting us now.\nCan you wonder? He would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is\njustified. And if I were superstitious I’d be frightened of the girl,\ntoo. It doesn’t do to injure young people. Have you ever heard of\nLorenzo de Medici?”</p><p>Miss Lavish bristled.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Most certainly I have. Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to\nLorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to</p>",
  "page-145": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of\nhis diminutive stature?”</p><p>“The Lord knows. Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the poet.\nHe wrote a line—so I heard yesterday—which runs like this: ‘Don’t go\nfighting against the Spring.’”</p><p>Mr. Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.</p><p>“Non fate guerra al Maggio,” he murmured. “‘War not with the May’ would\nrender a correct meaning.”</p><p>“The point is, we have warred with it. Look.” He pointed to the Val\nd’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.\n“Fifty miles of Spring, and we’ve come up to admire them. Do you suppose\nthere’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man? But\nthere we go, praising the one and condemning the other as improper,\nashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.”</p>",
  "page-146": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">No one encouraged him to talk. Presently Mr. Eager gave a signal for the\ncarriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill.\nA hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and misty\nolives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the road,\nstill following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory which\nstood out in the plain. It was this promontory, uncultivated, wet,\ncovered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the fancy of\nAlessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before. He had ascended\nit, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an eye to\nbusiness, possibly for the joy of ascending. Standing there, he had seen\nthat view of the Val d’Arno and distant Florence, which he afterwards\nhad introduced not very effectively into his work. But where exactly had\nhe stood? That was the question which Mr. Eager hoped to solve now. And\nMiss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything</p>",
  "page-147": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">problematical, had\nbecome equally enthusiastic.</p><p>But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in your\nhead, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting. And\nthe haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.</p><p>The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to keep\ntogether being only equalled by their desire to go different directions.\nFinally they split into groups. Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett and Miss\nLavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the\ndrivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics in\ncommon, were left to each other.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask. In the audible whisper\nthat was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio\nBaldovinetti, but the drive. Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson\nwhat his profession was, and he had answered “the railway.” She</p>",
  "page-148": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was very\nsorry that she had asked him. She had no idea that it would be such a\ndreadful answer, or she would not have asked him. Mr. Beebe had turned\nthe conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man was not\nvery much hurt at her asking him.</p><p>“The railway!” gasped Miss Lavish. “Oh, but I shall die! Of course it\nwas the railway!” She could not control her mirth. “He is the image of a\nporter—on, on the South-Eastern.”</p><p>“Eleanor, be quiet,” plucking at her vivacious companion. “Hush! They’ll\nhear—the Emersons—”</p><p>“I can’t stop. Let me go my wicked way. A porter—”</p><p>“Eleanor!”</p><p>“I’m sure it’s all right,” put in Lucy. “The Emersons won’t hear, and\nthey wouldn’t mind if they did.”</p><p>Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.</p><p>“Miss Honeychurch listening!” she said rather crossly. “Pouf! Wouf! You\nnaughty girl! Go away!”</p>",
  "page-149": "<p>“Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr. Eager, I’m sure.”</p><p>“I can’t find them now, and I don’t want to either.”</p><p>“Mr. Eager will be offended. It is your party.”</p><p>“Please, I’d rather stop here with you.”</p><p>“No, I agree,” said Miss Lavish. “It’s like a school feast; the boys\nhave got separated from the girls. Miss Lucy, you are to go. We wish to\nconverse on high topics unsuited for your ear.”</p><p>The girl was stubborn. As her time at Florence drew to its close she was\nonly at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent. Such a one was\nMiss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte. She wished she had\nnot called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her remark\nand seemed determined to get rid of her.</p><p>“How tired one gets,” said Miss Bartlett. “Oh, I do wish Freddy and your\nmother could be here.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely</p>",
  "page-150": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">usurped the functions of\nenthusiasm. Lucy did not look at the view either. She would not enjoy\nanything till she was safe at Rome.</p><p>“Then sit you down,” said Miss Lavish. “Observe my foresight.”</p><p>With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that\nprotect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.\nShe sat on one; who was to sit on the other?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Lucy; without a moment’s doubt, Lucy. The ground will do for me. Really\nI have not had rheumatism for years. If I do feel it coming on I shall\nstand. Imagine your mother’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet\nin your white linen.” She sat down heavily where the ground looked\nparticularly moist. “Here we are, all settled delightfully. Even if my\ndress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown. Sit down, dear;\nyou are too unselfish; you don’t assert yourself</p>",
  "page-151": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">enough.” She cleared\nher throat. “Now don’t be alarmed; this isn’t a cold. It’s the tiniest\ncough, and I have had it three days. It’s nothing to do with sitting\nhere at all.”</p><p>There was only one way of treating the situation. At the end of five\nminutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr. Eager, vanquished\nby the mackintosh square.</p><p>She addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the\ncarriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars. The miscreant, a bony\nyoung man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the courtesy\nof a host and the assurance of a relative.</p><p>“Dove?” said Lucy, after much anxious thought.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">His face lit up. Of course he knew where. Not so far either. His arm\nswept three-fourths of the horizon. He should just think he did know\nwhere. He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed</p>",
  "page-152": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">them\ntowards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.</p><p>More seemed necessary. What was the Italian for “clergyman”?</p><p>“Dove buoni uomini?” said she at last.</p><p>Good? Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings! He showed her his\ncigar.</p><p>“Uno—piu—piccolo,” was her next remark, implying “Has the cigar been\ngiven to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She was correct as usual. He tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to make\nit stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded his\nhat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of a\nminute was ready to conduct her. Italians are born knowing the way. It\nwould seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but as a\nchess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well\nas the</p>",
  "page-153": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">squares. Any one can find places, but the finding of people is a\ngift from God.</p><p>He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets. She thanked\nhim with real pleasure. In the company of this common man the world\nwas beautiful and direct. For the first time she felt the influence\nof Spring. His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other\nthings, existed in great profusion there; “would she like to see them?”</p><p>“Ma buoni uomini.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He bowed. Certainly. Good men first, violets afterwards. They proceeded\nbriskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker. They\nwere nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing round\nthem, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless\npieces. He was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the pliant\nboughs. She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness.</p>",
  "page-154": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Not a step, not a\ntwig, was unimportant to her.</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>There was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them. The voice\nof Mr. Eager? He shrugged his shoulders. An Italian’s ignorance is\nsometimes more remarkable than his knowledge. She could not make him\nunderstand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen. The view was\nforming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other\nhills.</p><p>“Eccolo!” he exclaimed.</p><p>At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of\nthe wood. Light and beauty enveloped her. She had fallen on to a little\nopen terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.</p><p>“Courage!” cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.\n“Courage and love.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She did not answer. From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view,\nand violets ran down in rivulets and</p>",

For a moment he\ncontemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven. He saw radiant\njoy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue\nwaves. The bushes above them closed. He stepped quickly forward and\nkissed her.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called,\n“Lucy! Lucy!

Mr. Emerson, seeking\nhis son, was told whereabouts to find him. Mr. Beebe, who wore the\nheated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the\nreturn home. There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment. Pan\nhad been amongst them—not the</p>",
  "page-158": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">great god Pan, who has been buried these\ntwo thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social\ncontretemps and unsuccessful picnics.

  "page-159": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">things\nwere, and what he wished them to be. He alone had interpreted the\nmessage that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a\ndying man.

Of\ncourse, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the\nbushes; he might make a tavern story out of it. But after all, what have\nwe to do with taverns? Real menace belongs to the drawing-room. It\nwas of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed\ndownwards towards the fading sun.

  "page-160": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious. They spoke\nof Alessio Baldovinetti.</p><p>Rain and darkness came on together. The two ladies huddled together\nunder an inadequate parasol. There was a lightning flash, and Miss\nLavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front. At the next\nflash, Lucy screamed also. Mr. Eager addressed her professionally:</p><p>“Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage and faith. If I might say so, there\nis something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements. Are we\nseriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical\ndisplay, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?”</p><p>“No—of course—”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being\nstruck are enormous.

  "page-161": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the other carriage. And, in any case, we are\ninfinitely safer than if we were walking. Courage—courage and faith.”</p><p>Under the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousin’s hand. At\ntimes our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care\nnot what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it\nafterwards. Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles,\ngained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross\nexamination.</p><p>She renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.</p><p>“Mr. Eager!” called Mr. Beebe. “We want your assistance. Will you\ninterpret for us?”</p><p>“George!” cried Mr. Emerson. “Ask your driver which way George went. The\nboy may lose his way.

  "page-162": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">driver; our driver is\nno help.

She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she\nshould describe it. All her sensations, her spasms of courage, her\nmoments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be\ncarefully laid before her cousin. And together in divine confidence they\nwould disentangle and interpret them all.</p><p>“At last,” thought she, “I shall understand myself. I shan’t again\nbe troubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don’t know\nwhat.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Miss Alan asked her to play. She refused vehemently.

  "page-167": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was listening to a long story about lost luggage.\nWhen it was over she capped it by a story of her own. Lucy became rather\nhysterical with the delay. In vain she tried to check, or at all events\nto accelerate, the tale. It was not till a late hour that Miss Bartlett\nhad recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle\nreproach:</p><p>“Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire. Come into my\nroom, and I will give a good brush to your hair.”</p><p>With some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the\ngirl. Then Miss Bartlett said “So what is to be done?”</p><p>She was unprepared for the question. It had not occurred to her that she\nwould have to do anything. A detailed exhibition of her emotions was all\nthat she had counted upon.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“What is to be done? A point, dearest, which you</p>",

A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt\nunaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes. She lifted\nthem to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and\nvague, the very ghosts of joy.</p><p>“It has been raining for nearly four hours,” she said at last.</p><p>Miss Bartlett ignored the remark.</p><p>“How do you propose to silence him?”</p><p>“The driver?”</p><p>“My dear girl, no; Mr. George Emerson.”</p><p>Lucy began to pace up and down the room.</p><p>“I don’t understand,” she said at last.</p>",
  "page-169": "<p>She understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely\ntruthful.</p><p>“How are you going to stop him talking about it?”</p><p>“I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.”</p><p>“I, too, intend to judge him charitably.

Come here\nand listen to me. I am only gathering it from his own remarks. Do you\nremember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one\nperson is an extra reason for liking another?”</p><p>“Yes,” said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Well, I am no prude.

Charlotte,\nwho was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk,\nvainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size.\nShe gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her back,\nand, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.

  "page-175": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier, the world\nbe happier, if she could give and receive some human love. The impulse\nhad come before to-day, but never so strongly. She knelt down by her\ncousin’s side and took her in her arms.</p><p>Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth.

For it was in ominous tones that she\nsaid, after a long pause:</p><p>“Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?”</p><p>Lucy was on her guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what\nforgiving Miss Bartlett meant. Her emotion relaxed, she modified her\nembrace a little, and she said:</p><p>“Charlotte dear, what do you mean? As if I have anything to forgive!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to</p>",

I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had\nhoped. I might have known it would not do. You want someone younger\nand stronger and more in sympathy with you. I am too uninteresting and\nold-fashioned—only fit to pack and unpack your things.”</p><p>“Please—”</p><p>“My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste, and\nwere often able to leave me at home. I had my own poor ideas of what a\nlady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was\nnecessary. You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.”</p>",
  "page-177": "<p>“You mustn’t say these things,” said Lucy softly.</p><p>She still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other,\nheart and soul. They continued to pack in silence.</p><p>“I have been a failure,” said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the\nstraps of Lucy’s trunk instead of strapping her own. “Failed to make you\nhappy; failed in my duty to your mother. She has been so generous to me;\nI shall never face her again after this disaster.”</p><p>“But mother will understand. It is not your fault, this trouble, and it\nisn’t a disaster either.”</p><p>“It is my fault, it is a disaster. She will never forgive me, and\nrightly. For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss\nLavish?”</p><p>“Every right.”</p><p>“When I was here for your sake? If I have vexed you it is equally true\nthat I have neglected you. Your mother will see this as clearly as I do,\nwhen you tell her.”</p>",

There is something sacred in it.\nUnless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her.”</p><p>The girl would not be degraded to this.</p><p>“Naturally I should have told her. But in case she should blame you in\nany way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to. I will never\nspeak of it either to her or to any one.”</p><p>Her promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close.

She had worked like a great artist; for a time—indeed,\nfor years—she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented\nto the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in which\nthe young rush to destruction until they learn better—a shamefaced\nworld of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but which do not\nseem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have used them most.</p>",

A poet—none was\npresent—might have quoted, “Life like a dome of many coloured glass,”\n or might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against\nthe intolerable tides of heaven.

  "page-183": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">visible, was tempered to the capacities of\nman.</p><p>Two pleasant people sat in the room. One—a boy of nineteen—was\nstudying a small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone\nwhich lay upon the piano. From time to time he bounced in his chair and\npuffed and groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the\nhuman frame fearfully made; and his mother, who was writing a letter,\ndid continually read out to him what she had written. And continually\ndid she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of\nlight fell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still\nthere.</p><p>“Where aren’t they?” said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy’s brother. “I\ntell you I’m getting fairly sick.”</p><p>“For goodness’ sake go out of my drawing-room, then?” cried Mrs.\nHoneychurch, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it\nliterally.</p><p>Freddy did not move or reply.</p>",
  "page-184": "<p>“I think things are coming to a head,” she observed, rather wanting\nher son’s opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue\nsupplication.</p><p>“Time they did.”</p><p>“I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more.”</p><p>“It’s his third go, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean to be unkind.” Then he added: “But I do think Lucy might\nhave got this off her chest in Italy. I don’t know how girls manage\nthings, but she can’t have said ‘No’ properly before, or she wouldn’t\nhave to say it again now. Over the whole thing—I can’t explain—I do\nfeel so uncomfortable.”</p><p>“Do you indeed, dear? How interesting!”</p><p>“I feel—never mind.”</p><p>He returned to his work.</p><p>“Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse. I said: ‘Dear Mrs.\nVyse.’”</p>",
  "page-185": "<p>“Yes, mother, you told me. A jolly good letter.”</p><p>“I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about\nit, and I should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it.

When it comes to the point, he can’t get on without me.”</p><p>“Nor me.”</p><p>“You?”</p><p>Freddy nodded.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“He asked me for my permission also.”</p><p>She exclaimed: “How very odd of him!”</p><p>“Why so?” asked the son and heir. “Why shouldn’t my permission be\nasked?”</p><p>“What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything?

For a\nbrief space they were silent. Close by, beyond the curtains, the gentle\nmurmur of a long conversation had never ceased.</p>",
  "page-187": "<p>“The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.”\n He gave a nervous gulp. “Not content with ‘permission’, which I did\ngive—that is to say, I said, ‘I don’t mind’—well, not content with\nthat, he wanted to know whether I wasn’t off my head with joy. He\npractically put it like this: Wasn’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and\nfor Windy Corner generally if he married her? And he would have an\nanswer—he said it would strengthen his hand.”</p><p>“I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.”</p><p>“I answered ‘No’” said the boy, grinding his teeth. “There! Fly into a\nstew! I can’t help it—had to say it. I had to say no. He ought never to\nhave asked me.”</p><p>“Ridiculous child!” cried his mother. “You think you’re so holy and\ntruthful, but really it’s only abominable conceit. Do you suppose that\na man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say? I\nhope he boxed your ears. How dare you say no?”</p>",
  "page-188": "<p>“Oh, do keep quiet, mother! I had to say no when I couldn’t say yes.

Oh,\ndo keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.”</p><p>“No,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the\nsubject, “I shall not keep quiet. You know all that has passed between\nthem in Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately\ninsult him, and try to turn him out of my house.”</p><p>“Not a bit!” he pleaded. “I only let out I didn’t like him.

  "page-189": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">connected.” She paused, as if rehearsing her eulogy, but her face\nremained dissatisfied. She added: “And he has beautiful manners.”</p><p>“I liked him till just now. I suppose it’s having him spoiling Lucy’s\nfirst week at home; and it’s also something that Mr. Beebe said, not\nknowing.”</p><p>“Mr. Beebe?” said his mother, trying to conceal her interest. “I don’t\nsee how Mr. Beebe comes in.”</p><p>“You know Mr. Beebe’s funny way, when you never quite know what he\nmeans. He said: ‘Mr. Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’ I was very cute, I\nasked him what he meant. He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better detached.’ I\ncouldn’t make him say any more, but it set me thinking. Since Cecil has\ncome after Lucy he hasn’t been so pleasant, at least—I can’t explain.”</p><p>“You never can, dear. But I can. You are jealous of Cecil because he may\nstop Lucy knitting you silk ties.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried</p>",
  "page-190": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to accept it. But at\nthe back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust. Cecil praised one too\nmuch for being athletic. Was that it? Cecil made one talk in one’s own\nway. This tired one. Was that it? And Cecil was the kind of fellow who\nwould never wear another fellow’s cap. Unaware of his own profundity,\nFreddy checked himself. He must be jealous, or he would not dislike a\nman for such foolish reasons.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Will this do?” called his mother. “‘Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just\nasked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes\nit.’ Then I put in at the top, ‘and I have told Lucy so.’ I must write\nthe letter out again—‘and I have told Lucy so. But Lucy seems very\nuncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.’ I\nsaid that because I didn’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned.

Oh yes—‘Young people must\ndecide for themselves.

He couldn’t bear the\nHoneychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture.\nInstinctively he give the curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging down\ntheir poles. Light entered. There was revealed a terrace, such as is\nowned by many villas with trees each side of it, and on it a little\nrustic seat, and two flower-beds. But it was transfigured by the view\nbeyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the\nSussex Weald.

Tall and refined, with shoulders\nthat seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that\nwas tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled\nthose fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.\nWell educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he\nremained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows\nas self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision,\nworshipped as asceticism. A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as\na Greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe\nmeant. And Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same\nwhen he failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellow’s cap.</p><p>Mrs. Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards\nher young acquaintance.</p><p>“Oh, Cecil!” she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!”</p>",
  "page-194": "<p>“I promessi sposi,” said he.</p><p>They stared at him anxiously.</p><p>“She has accepted me,” he said, and the sound of the thing in English\nmade him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.</p><p>“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand\nthat was yellow with chemicals. They wished that they also knew Italian,\nfor our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with\nlittle occasions that we fear to use them on great ones.

  "page-196": "<p>“Yes, you go with Lucy.”</p><p>They passed into the sunlight. Cecil watched them cross the terrace,\nand descend out of sight by the steps. They would descend—he knew their\nways—past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed,\nuntil they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of the\npotatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.</p><p>Smiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that\nhad led to such a happy conclusion.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl\nwho happened to be musical. He could still remember his depression that\nafternoon at Rome, when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out\nof the blue, and demanded to be taken to St. Peter’s. That day she had\nseemed a typical tourist—shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel. But\nItaly worked some marvel in her. It gave her light, and—which he held\nmore</p>",
  "page-197": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">precious—it gave her shadow. Soon he detected in her a wonderful\nreticence. She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we love\nnot so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us. The\nthings are assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo’s could have\nanything so vulgar as a “story.” She did develop most wonderfully day by\nday.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if\nnot to passion, at least to a profound uneasiness. Already at Rome he\nhad hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other. It had\ntouched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion.\nHer refusal had been clear and gentle; after it—as the horrid phrase\nwent—she had been exactly the same to him as before. Three months\nlater, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he had asked\nher again in bald, traditional language. She reminded him of a Leonardo\nmore than ever; her</p>",
  "page-198": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock;\nat his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with\nimmeasurable plains behind her. He walked home with her unashamed,\nfeeling not at all like a rejected suitor. The things that really\nmattered were unshaken.</p><p>So now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she\nhad accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply saying\nthat she loved him and would do her best to make him happy. His mother,\ntoo, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must write her a\nlong account.</p><p>Glancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy’s chemicals had come off\non it, he moved to the writing table. There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,”\n followed by many erasures. He recoiled without reading any more, and\nafter a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on\nhis knee.</p>",
  "page-199": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as\nthe first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner\ndrawing-room more distinctive.

Shoolbred and Messrs.\nMaple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished\nbook-cases, that writing-table. The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch’s\nletter. He did not want to read that letter—his temptations never lay\nin that direction; but he worried about it none the less. It was his\nown fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted her\nsupport in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted to feel that others,\nno matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked their\npermission. Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in essentials,\nwhile as for Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he</p>",

Why should he want me for a brother-in-law?”</p><p>The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize\nthat Lucy was of another clay; and perhaps—he did not put it very\ndefinitely—he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as\nsoon as possible.</p><p>“Mr. Beebe!” said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was\nshown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy’s\npraise of him in her letters from Florence.</p><p>Cecil greeted him rather critically.</p><p>“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse. Do you suppose that I shall get it?”</p><p>“I should say so. Food is the thing one does get here—Don’t sit in that\nchair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.”</p><p>“Pfui!”</p>",
  "page-201": "<p>“I know,” said Cecil. “I know. I can’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows\nit.”</p><p>For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples’ furniture separately; he\ndid not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the\nlife that he desired.</p><p>“I’ve come for tea and for gossip. Isn’t this news?”</p><p>“News? I don’t understand you,” said Cecil. “News?”</p><p>Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.</p><p>“I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I\nam first in the field. He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Has he indeed?” said Cecil, trying to recover himself. Into what a\ngrotesque mistake had he fallen! Was it likely that a clergyman and a\ngentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant? But</p>",
  "page-202": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">his\nstiffness remained, and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert might be,\nhe still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.</p><p>“Unpardonable question! To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not\nto have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been\nrun up opposite the church! I’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.”</p><p>“I’m shockingly stupid over local affairs,” said the young man\nlanguidly. “I can’t even remember the difference between a Parish\nCouncil and a Local Government Board. Perhaps there is no difference, or\nperhaps those aren’t the right names. I only go into the country to see\nmy friends and to enjoy the scenery. It is very remiss of me. Italy and\nLondon are the only places where I don’t feel to exist on sufferance.”</p><p>Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert,\ndetermined to shift the subject.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Let me see, Mr. Vyse—I forget—what is your</p>",
  "page-203": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">profession?”</p><p>“I have no profession,” said Cecil. “It is another example of my\ndecadence. My attitude—quite an indefensible one—is that so long as I\nam no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like. I know I ought\nto be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don’t\ncare a straw about, but somehow, I’ve not been able to begin.”</p><p>“You are very fortunate,” said Mr. Beebe. “It is a wonderful\nopportunity, the possession of leisure.”</p><p>His voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to\nanswering naturally. He felt, as all who have regular occupation must\nfeel, that others should have it also.</p><p>“I am glad that you approve. I daren’t face the healthy person—for\nexample, Freddy Honeychurch.”</p><p>“Oh, Freddy’s a good sort, isn’t he?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Admirable. The sort who has made England what</p>",
  "page-204": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">she is.”</p><p>Cecil wondered at himself. Why, on this day of all others, was he so\nhopelessly contrary? He tried to get right by inquiring effusively after\nMr. Beebe’s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular regard.\nThen he flattered the clergyman, praised his liberal-mindedness, his\nenlightened attitude towards philosophy and science.</p><p>“Where are the others?” said Mr. Beebe at last, “I insist on extracting\ntea before evening service.”</p><p>“I suppose Anne never told them you were here. In this house one is so\ncoached in the servants the day one arrives. The fault of Anne is\nthat she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the\nchair-legs with her feet. The faults of Mary—I forget the faults of\nMary, but they are very grave. Shall we look in the garden?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I know the faults of Mary. She leaves the dust-pans</p>",
  "page-205": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">standing on the\nstairs.”</p><p>“The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the\nsuet sufficiently small.”</p><p>They both laughed, and things began to go better.</p><p>“The faults of Freddy—” Cecil continued.</p><p>“Ah, he has too many. No one but his mother can remember the faults of\nFreddy. Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.”</p><p>“She has none,” said the young man, with grave sincerity.</p><p>“I quite agree. At present she has none.”</p><p>“At present?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I’m not cynical. I’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss\nHoneychurch. Does it seem reasonable that she should play so\nwonderfully, and live so quietly? I suspect that one day she will be\nwonderful in both. The water-tight compartments in her will break down,\nand music and life will mingle. Then we shall have her</p>",
  "page-206": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">heroically good,\nheroically bad—too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.”</p><p>Cecil found his companion interesting.</p><p>“And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?”</p><p>“Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was\nnot wonderful, and at Florence. Since I came to Summer Street she has\nbeen away. You saw her, didn’t you, at Rome and in the Alps. Oh, I\nforgot; of course, you knew her before. No, she wasn’t wonderful in\nFlorence either, but I kept on expecting that she would be.”</p><p>“In what way?”</p><p>Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and\ndown the terrace.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next. There was simply\nthe sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them. I can show\nyou a beautiful</p>",
  "page-207": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a\nkite, Miss Bartlett holding the string. Picture number two: the string\nbreaks.”</p><p>The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he\nviewed things artistically. At the time he had given surreptitious tugs\nto the string himself.</p><p>“But the string never broke?”</p><p>“No. I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly\nhave heard Miss Bartlett fall.”</p><p>“It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.</p><p>Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous,\ncontemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst. He\ncursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and\nthat Lucy was soaring up to reach him?</p><p>“Broken? What do you mean?”</p>",
  "page-208": "<p>“I meant,” said Cecil stiffly, “that she is going to marry me.”</p><p>The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could\nnot keep out of his voice.</p><p>“I am sorry; I must apologize. I had no idea you were intimate with her,\nor I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way. Mr.\nVyse, you ought to have stopped me.” And down the garden he saw Lucy\nherself; yes, he was disappointed.</p><p>Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down\nhis mouth at the corners. Was this the reception his action would get\nfrom the world? Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every\nthoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement. But he was\nsensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.</p><p>Occasionally he could be quite crude.</p>",
  "page-209": "<p>“I am sorry I have given you a shock,” he said dryly. “I fear that\nLucy’s choice does not meet with your approval.”</p><p>“Not that. But you ought to have stopped me.

Perhaps I oughtn’t to have discussed her so\nfreely with any one; certainly not with you.”</p><p>“You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?”</p><p>Mr. Beebe pulled himself together. Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of\nplacing one in the most tiresome positions. He was driven to use the\nprerogatives of his profession.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“No, I have said nothing indiscreet. I foresaw at Florence that her\nquiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended. I realized dimly\nenough that she might take some momentous step. She has taken it.

  "page-210": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">freely—she has\nlearnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will tell\nyou, that our earthly life provides.” It was now time for him to wave\nhis hat at the approaching trio. He did not omit to do so. “She has\nlearnt through you,” and if his voice was still clerical, it was now\nalso sincere; “let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to\nher.”</p><p>“Grazie tante!” said Cecil, who did not like parsons.</p><p>“Have you heard?” shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping\ngarden. “Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?”</p><p>Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march. Youth seldom\ncriticizes the accomplished fact.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Indeed I have!” he cried. He looked at Lucy. In her presence he could\nnot act the parson any longer—at all events not without apology.\n“Mrs. Honeychurch, I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but\ngenerally I’m too shy. I want to invoke every kind of</p>",
  "page-211": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">blessing on\nthem, grave and gay, great and small. I want them all their lives to be\nsupremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and\nmother. And now I want my tea.”</p><p>“You only asked for it just in time,” the lady retorted. “How dare you\nbe serious at Windy Corner?”</p><p>He took his tone from her. There was no more heavy beneficence, no more\nattempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures. None of\nthem dared or was able to be serious any more.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all\nwho speak of it to this state of cheerful awe. Away from it, in the\nsolitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be\ncritical. But in its presence and in the presence of each other they\nwere sincerely hilarious. It has a strange power, for it compels not\nonly the lips, but the very heart. The chief parallel to compare one\ngreat thing</p>",
  "page-212": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">with another—is the power over us of a temple of some alien\ncreed. Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel\nsentimental.

If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their\nhypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true. Anne,\nputting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated them\ngreatly. They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave\nthem ere she kicked the drawing-room door. Mr. Beebe chirruped. Freddy\nwas at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the “Fiasco”—family honoured\npun on fiance. Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised well as\na mother-in-law.

  "page-215": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">social blunder, but it pleased\nher, and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy\ndowagers.</p><p>At tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy’s\nfigured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned\nnothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated\nby a sympathetic maid.

All those old women\nsmirking!”</p><p>“One has to go through it, I suppose. They won’t notice us so much next\ntime.”</p><p>“But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong. An\nengagement—horrid word in the first place—is a private matter, and\nshould be treated as such.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Yet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially\ncorrect. The spirit of the generations had smiled through them,\nrejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised</p>",
  "page-217": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the\ncontinuance of life on earth. To Cecil and Lucy it promised something\nquite different—personal love. Hence Cecil’s irritation and Lucy’s\nbelief that his irritation was just.</p><p>“How tiresome!” she said. “Couldn’t you have escaped to tennis?”</p><p>“I don’t play tennis—at least, not in public. The neighbourhood is\ndeprived of the romance of me being athletic. Such romance as I have is\nthat of the Inglese Italianato.”</p><p>“Inglese Italianato?”</p><p>“E un diavolo incarnato! You know the proverb?”</p><p>She did not. Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a\nquiet winter in Rome with his mother.

Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same\nplace.”</p><p>“We were speaking of motives,” said Cecil, on whom the interruption\njarred.</p>",
  "page-219": "<p>“My dear Cecil, look here.” She spread out her knees and perched her\ncard-case on her lap. “This is me. That’s Windy Corner. The rest of the\npattern is the other people. Motives are all very well, but the fence\ncomes here.”</p><p>“We weren’t talking of real fences,” said Lucy, laughing.</p><p>“Oh, I see, dear—poetry.”</p><p>She leant placidly back. Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.</p><p>“I tell you who has no ‘fences,’ as you call them,” she said, “and\nthat’s Mr. Beebe.”</p><p>“A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.”</p><p>Lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect\nwhat they meant.

  "page-220": "<p>“I never said so!” he cried. “I consider him far above the average.

He was truly\ninsincere—not merely the manner unfortunate. He was a snob, and so\nconceited, and he did say such unkind things.”</p><p>“What sort of things?”</p><p>“There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his\nwife.”</p><p>“Perhaps he had.”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Why ‘no’?”</p><p>“He was such a nice old man, I’m sure.”</p><p>Cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Well, I did try to sift the thing.

  "page-221": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">never come to the\npoint. He prefers it vague—said the old man had ‘practically’ murdered\nhis wife—had murdered her in the sight of God.”</p><p>“Hush, dear!” said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.</p><p>“But isn’t it intolerable that a person whom we’re told to imitate\nshould go round spreading slander? It was, I believe, chiefly owing to\nhim that the old man was dropped. People pretended he was vulgar, but he\ncertainly wasn’t that.”</p><p>“Poor old man! What was his name?”</p><p>“Harris,” said Lucy glibly.</p><p>“Let’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person,” said her\nmother.</p><p>Cecil nodded intelligently.</p><p>“Isn’t Mr. Eager a parson of the cultured type?” he asked.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I don’t know.

It was as if one should see the Leonardo on the\nceiling of the Sistine. He longed to hint to her that not here lay\nher vocation; that a woman’s power and charm reside in mystery, not\nin muscular rant. But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the\nbeautiful creature, but shows that she is alive. After a moment, he\ncontemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain\napproval. He forebore to repress the sources of youth.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Nature—simplest of topics, he thought—lay around them.

When I’m in the country I feel the\nsame about the country. After all, I do believe that birds and trees and\nthe sky are the most wonderful things in life, and that the people who\nlive amongst them must be the best. It’s true that in nine cases out of\nten they don’t seem to notice anything. The country gentleman and\nthe country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of\ncompanions.

He had had full\nwarning of Mr. Flack’s intentions, and might have bought the plot before\nbuilding commenced: but he was apathetic and dilatory. He had known\nSummer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it being\nspoilt. Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and the\napparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm.\nHe called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,—a most</p>",
  "page-228": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">reasonable and\nrespectful man—who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic\nroof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper. He ventured to differ,\nhowever, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches\nto the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his part, he liked\nto relieve the facade by a bit of decoration. Sir Harry hinted that a\ncolumn, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.</p><p>Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, “and\nall the capitals different—one with dragons in the foliage, another\napproaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack’s\ninitials—everyone different.” For he had read his Ruskin. He built\nhis villas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an\nimmovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness\nas he leant on Mrs. Honeychurch’s</p>",
  "page-229": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">carriage. He had failed in his duties\nto the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.\nHe had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.\nAll he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for “Cissie”—some\none really desirable.</p><p>“The rent is absurdly low,” he told them, “and perhaps I am an easy\nlandlord. But it is such an awkward size. It is too large for the\npeasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.”</p><p>Cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or\ndespise Sir Harry for despising them. The latter impulse seemed the more\nfruitful.</p><p>“You ought to find a tenant at once,” he said maliciously. “It would be\na perfect paradise for a bank clerk.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Exactly!” said Sir Harry excitedly. “That is exactly what I fear, Mr.\nVyse. It will attract the wrong type of people. The train service has\nimproved—a fatal</p>",
  "page-230": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">improvement, to my mind. And what are five miles from\na station in these days of bicycles?”</p><p>“Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,” said Lucy.</p><p>Cecil, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied\nthat the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a\nmost appalling rate. She saw that he was laughing at their harmless\nneighbour, and roused herself to stop him.</p><p>“Sir Harry!” she exclaimed, “I have an idea. How would you like\nspinsters?”</p><p>“My dear Lucy, it would be splendid. Do you know any such?”</p><p>“Yes; I met them abroad.”</p><p>“Gentlewomen?” he asked tentatively.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless. I heard from them last\nweek—Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan. I’m really not joking. They\nare quite the right people. Mr. Beebe knows them, too. May I tell</p>",
  "page-231": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">them\nto write to you?”</p><p>“Indeed you may!” he cried. “Here we are with the difficulty solved\nalready. How delightful it is! Extra facilities—please tell them they\nshall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents’ fees. Oh,\nthe agents! The appalling people they have sent me! One woman, when\nI wrote—a tactful letter, you know—asking her to explain her social\nposition to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance. As\nif one cares about that! And several references I took up were most\nunsatisfactory—people swindlers, or not respectable. And oh, the\ndeceit! I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week. The\ndeceit of the most promising people. My dear Lucy, the deceit!”</p><p>She nodded.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“My advice,” put in Mrs. Honeychurch, “is to have nothing to do with\nLucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all. I know the type. Preserve me\nfrom people who</p>",
  "page-232": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them\nthat make the house smell stuffy. It’s a sad thing, but I’d far rather\nlet to someone who is going up in the world than to someone who has\ncome down.”</p><p>“I think I follow you,” said Sir Harry; “but it is, as you say, a very\nsad thing.”</p><p>“The Misses Alan aren’t that!” cried Lucy.</p><p>“Yes, they are,” said Cecil. “I haven’t met them but I should say they\nwere a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.”</p><p>“Don’t listen to him, Sir Harry—he’s tiresome.”</p><p>“It’s I who am tiresome,” he replied. “I oughtn’t to come with my\ntroubles to young people. But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway\nwill only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no\nreal help.”</p><p>“Then may I write to my Misses Alan?”</p><p>“Please!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But his eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch</p>",
  "page-233": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">exclaimed:</p><p>“Beware! They are certain to have canaries. Sir Harry, beware of\ncanaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then\nthe mice come. Beware of women altogether. Only let to a man.”</p><p>“Really—” he murmured gallantly, though he saw the wisdom of her\nremark.</p><p>“Men don’t gossip over tea-cups. If they get drunk, there’s an end of\nthem—they lie down comfortably and sleep it off. If they’re vulgar,\nthey somehow keep it to themselves. It doesn’t spread so. Give me a\nman—of course, provided he’s clean.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Sir Harry blushed. Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments\nto their sex. Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much\ndistinction. He suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she had time, should\ndescend from the carriage and inspect “Cissie” for herself. She was\ndelighted. Nature had intended her</p>",
  "page-234": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to be poor and to live in such a\nhouse. Domestic arrangements always attracted her, especially when they\nwere on a small scale.</p><p>Cecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother.</p><p>“Mrs. Honeychurch,” he said, “what if we two walk home and leave you?”</p><p>“Certainly!” was her cordial reply.</p><p>Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them. He beamed\nat them knowingly, said, “Aha! young people, young people!” and then\nhastened to unlock the house.</p><p>“Hopeless vulgarian!” exclaimed Cecil, almost before they were out of\nearshot.</p><p>“Oh, Cecil!”</p><p>“I can’t help it. It would be wrong not to loathe that man.”</p><p>“He isn’t clever, but really he is nice.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“No, Lucy, he stands for all that is bad in country</p>",
  "page-235": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">life. In London he\nwould keep his place. He would belong to a brainless club, and his wife\nwould give brainless dinner parties. But down here he acts the little\ngod with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and\neveryone—even your mother—is taken in.”</p><p>“All that you say is quite true,” said Lucy, though she felt\ndiscouraged. “I wonder whether—whether it matters so very much.”</p><p>“It matters supremely. Sir Harry is the essence of that garden-party.\nOh, goodness, how cross I feel! How I do hope he’ll get some vulgar\ntenant in that villa—some woman so really vulgar that he’ll notice\nit. GENTLEFOLKS! Ugh! with his bald head and retreating chin! But let’s\nforget him.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This Lucy was glad enough to do. If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and\nMr. Beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered\nto her would</p>",
  "page-236": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">escape? For instance, Freddy. Freddy was neither clever,\nnor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented Cecil from saying, any\nminute, “It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy”? And what would she\nreply? Further than Freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety\nenough. She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some\ntime, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps,\nduring the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.</p><p>“Which way shall we go?” she asked him.</p><p>Nature—simplest of topics, she thought—was around them. Summer Street\nlay deep in the woods, and she had stopped where a footpath diverged\nfrom the highroad.</p><p>“Are there two ways?”</p><p>“Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we’re got up smart.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I’d rather go through the wood,” said Cecil, With</p>",
  "page-237": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that subdued\nirritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon. “Why is it,\nLucy, that you always say the road? Do you know that you have never once\nbeen with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?”</p><p>“Haven’t I? The wood, then,” said Lucy, startled at his queerness, but\npretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave\nher in doubt as to his meaning.</p><p>She led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he did\nexplain before they had gone a dozen yards.</p><p>“I had got an idea—I dare say wrongly—that you feel more at home with\nme in a room.”</p><p>“A room?” she echoed, hopelessly bewildered.</p><p>“Yes. Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road. Never in the real\ncountry like this.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean? I have never felt anything of the\nsort. You talk as if I was a kind of</p>",
  "page-238": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">poetess sort of person.”</p><p>“I don’t know that you aren’t. I connect you with a view—a certain type\nof view. Why shouldn’t you connect me with a room?”</p><p>She reflected a moment, and then said, laughing:</p><p>“Do you know that you’re right? I do. I must be a poetess after all.\nWhen I think of you it’s always as in a room. How funny!”</p><p>To her surprise, he seemed annoyed.</p><p>“A drawing-room, pray? With no view?”</p><p>“Yes, with no view, I fancy. Why not?”</p><p>“I’d rather,” he said reproachfully, “that you connected me with the open\nair.”</p><p>She said again, “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">As no explanation was forthcoming, she shook off the subject as too\ndifficult for a girl, and led him further into the wood, pausing every\nnow and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of\nthe</p>",
  "page-239": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">trees. She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy Corner\never since she could walk alone; she had played at losing Freddy in it,\nwhen Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to Italy,\nit had lost none of its charm.</p><p>Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines—another tiny\ngreen alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.</p><p>She exclaimed, “The Sacred Lake!”</p><p>“Why do you call it that?”</p><p>“I can’t remember why. I suppose it comes out of some book. It’s only a\npuddle now, but you see that stream going through it? Well, a good deal\nof water comes down after heavy rains, and can’t get away at once, and\nthe pool becomes quite large and beautiful. Then Freddy used to bathe\nthere. He is very fond of it.”</p><p>“And you?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He meant, “Are you fond of it?” But she answered</p>",
  "page-240": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">dreamily, “I bathed\nhere, too, till I was found out. Then there was a row.”</p><p>At another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of\nprudishness within him. But now? with his momentary cult of the fresh\nair, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity. He looked at her as\nshe stood by the pool’s edge. She was got up smart, as she phrased it,\nand she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its\nown, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.</p><p>“Who found you out?”</p><p>“Charlotte,” she murmured. “She was stopping with us.\nCharlotte—Charlotte.”</p><p>“Poor girl!”</p><p>She smiled gravely. A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had shrunk,\nnow appeared practical.</p><p>“Lucy!”</p><p>“Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply.</p>",
  "page-241": "<p>“Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.”</p><p>At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards\nhim.</p><p>“What, Cecil?”</p><p>“Hitherto never—not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry\nme—”</p><p>He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were\nobserved. His courage had gone.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Up to now I have never kissed you.”</p><p>She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately.</p><p>“No—more you have,” she stammered.</p><p>“Then I ask you—may I now?”</p><p>“Of course, you may, Cecil. You might before. I can’t run at you, you\nknow.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At that supreme moment he was conscious of</p>",
  "page-242": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">nothing but absurdities. Her\nreply was inadequate.

He recast the scene. Lucy was\nstanding flowerlike by the water, he rushed up and took her in his\narms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his\nmanliness.

Her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built\nWindy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up,\nand, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living there\nhimself. Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.\nOther houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and\nothers, again, among the pine-trees behind,</p>",
  "page-245": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and northward on the chalk\nbarrier of the downs. Most of these houses were larger than Windy\nCorner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but\nfrom London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an\nindigenous aristocracy. He was inclined to be frightened, but his wife\naccepted the situation without either pride or humility. “I cannot think\nwhat people are doing,” she would say, “but it is extremely fortunate\nfor the children.” She called everywhere; her calls were returned with\nenthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she was not exactly\nof their milieu, they liked her, and it did not seem to matter. When Mr.\nHoneychurch died, he had the satisfaction—which few honest solicitors\ndespise—of leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The best obtainable. Certainly many of the immigrants were rather\ndull, and Lucy realized this</p>",
  "page-246": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">more vividly since her return from Italy.\nHitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning—their kindly\naffluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags,\norange-peel, and broken bottles. A Radical out and out, she learnt to\nspeak with horror of Suburbia. Life, so far as she troubled to conceive\nit, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and\nidentical foes. In this circle, one thought, married, and died. Outside\nit were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the\nLondon fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in\nthe northern hills. But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm\nhimself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.\nHer senses expanded; she felt that there was no one whom she might not\nget to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not\nparticularly high. You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant’s\nolive-yard in the Apennines, and he is</p>",
  "page-247": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">glad to see you. She returned\nwith new eyes.</p><p>So did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to\nirritation. He saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead\nof saying, “Does that very much matter?” he rebelled, and tried to\nsubstitute for it the society he called broad. He did not realize that\nLucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities\nthat create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its\ndefects, her heart refused to despise it entirely. Nor did he realize\na more important point—that if she was too great for this society, she\nwas too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal\nintercourse would alone satisfy her. A rebel she was, but not of the\nkind he understood—a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but\nequality beside the man she loved. For Italy was offering her the most\npriceless of all possessions—her own soul.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Playing bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to</p>",
  "page-248": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the rector, and\naged thirteen—an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in\nstriking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net\nand immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost. The\nsentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy’s state of mind,\nfor she was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.</p><p>“Oh, it has been such a nuisance—first he, then they—no one knowing\nwhat they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.”</p><p>“But they really are coming now,” said Mr. Beebe. “I wrote to Miss\nTeresa a few days ago—she was wondering how often the butcher called,\nand my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably. They\nare coming. I heard from them this morning.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I shall hate those Miss Alans!” Mrs. Honeychurch cried. “Just because\nthey’re old and silly one’s expected to say ‘How sweet!’ I hate\ntheir ‘if’-ing and ‘but’-ing and</p>",

Cecil was absent—one did not play bumble-puppy when he\nwas there.</p><p>“Well, if they are coming—No, Minnie, not Saturn.” Saturn was a\ntennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn. When in motion his orb was\nencircled by a ring. “If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move\nin before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about\nwhitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the\nfair wear and tear one.—That doesn’t count. I told you not Saturn.”</p><p>“Saturn’s all right for bumble-puppy,” cried Freddy, joining them.\n“Minnie, don’t you listen to her.”</p><p>“Saturn doesn’t bounce.”</p><p>“Saturn bounces enough.”</p><p>“No, he doesn’t.”</p>",
  "page-250": "<p>“Well; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil.”</p><p>“Hush, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.</p><p>“But look at Lucy—complaining of Saturn, and all the time’s got the\nBeautiful White Devil in her hand, ready to plug it in. That’s right,\nMinnie, go for her—get her over the shins with the racquet—get her\nover the shins!”</p><p>Lucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand.</p><p>Mr. Beebe picked it up, and said: “The name of this ball is Vittoria\nCorombona, please.” But his correction passed unheeded.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls\nto fury, and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a\nwell-mannered child into a howling wilderness. Up in the house Cecil\nheard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did</p>",
  "page-251": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">not\ncome down to impart it, in case he got hurt. He was not a coward and\nbore necessary pain as well as any man. But he hated the physical\nviolence of the young. How right it was!

  "page-252": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">said to me: ‘Ahem!\nHoneychurch,’”—Freddy was an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem! ahem!

More like Anderson.”</p><p>“Oh, good gracious, there isn’t going to be another muddle!” Mrs.\nHoneychurch exclaimed. “Do you notice, Lucy, I’m always right? I said\ndon’t interfere with Cissie Villa. I’m always right. I’m quite uneasy at\nbeing always right so often.”</p><p>“It’s only another muddle of Freddy’s. Freddy doesn’t even know the name\nof the people he pretends have taken it instead.”</p><p>“Yes, I do. I’ve got it. Emerson.”</p><p>“What name?”</p><p>“Emerson. I’ll bet you anything you like.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“What a weathercock Sir Harry is,” said Lucy</p>",
  "page-253": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">quietly. “I wish I had\nnever bothered over it at all.”</p><p>Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky. Mr. Beebe,\nwhose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that THAT was\nthe proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.</p><p>Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch from\nthe contemplation of her own abilities.</p><p>“Emerson, Freddy? Do you know what Emersons they are?”</p><p>“I don’t know whether they’re any Emersons,” retorted Freddy, who was\ndemocratic. Like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally\nattracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there\nare different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I trust they are the right sort of person.

  "page-254": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">down your nose and thinking your\nmother’s a snob. But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it’s\naffectation to pretend there isn’t.”</p><p>“Emerson’s a common enough name,” Lucy remarked.</p><p>She was gazing sideways. Seated on a promontory herself, she could see\nthe pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the Weald.\nThe further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this lateral\nview.</p><p>“I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no\nrelations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man. Pray, does that\nsatisfy you?”</p><p>“Oh, yes,” he grumbled. “And you will be satisfied, too, for they’re\nfriends of Cecil; so”—elaborate irony—“you and the other country\nfamilies will be able to call in perfect safety.”</p><p>“CECIL?” exclaimed Lucy.</p>",
  "page-255": "<p>“Don’t be rude, dear,” said his mother placidly. “Lucy, don’t screech.\nIt’s a new bad habit you’re getting into.”</p><p>“But has Cecil—”</p><p>“Friends of Cecil’s,” he repeated, “‘and so really dee-sire-rebel. Ahem!\nHoneychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.’”</p><p>She got up from the grass.</p><p>It was hard on Lucy. Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much. While she\nbelieved that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry Otway,\nshe had borne it like a good girl. She might well “screech” when\nshe heard that it came partly from her lover. Mr. Vyse was a\ntease—something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure\nin thwarting people. The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss\nHoneychurch with more than his usual kindness.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">When she exclaimed, “But Cecil’s Emersons—they</p>",
  "page-256": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">can’t possibly be the\nsame ones—there is that—” he did not consider that the exclamation\nwas strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation\nwhile she recovered her composure. He diverted it as follows:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean? No, I don’t suppose it\nwill prove to be them. It is probably a long cry from them to friends\nof Mr. Vyse’s. Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people! The queerest\npeople! For our part we liked them, didn’t we?” He appealed to Lucy.\n“There was a great scene over some violets. They picked violets and\nfilled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have\nfailed to come to Cissie Villa. Poor little ladies! So shocked and so\npleased. It used to be one of Miss Catharine’s great stories. ‘My dear\nsister loves flowers,’ it began. They found the whole room a mass of\nblue—vases and jugs—and the story ends with ‘So ungentlemanly and yet\nso beautiful.’ It is all very</p>",
  "page-257": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">difficult. Yes, I always connect those\nFlorentine Emersons with violets.”</p><p>“Fiasco’s done you this time,” remarked Freddy, not seeing that his\nsister’s face was very red. She could not recover herself. Mr. Beebe saw\nit, and continued to divert the conversation.</p><p>“These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son—the son\na goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very\nimmature—pessimism, et cetera. Our special joy was the father—such a\nsentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.”</p><p>In his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip,\nbut he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble.

Who could foretell that she and George\nwould meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of coats\nand collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth? She had\nimagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or indifferent\nor furtively impudent. She was prepared for all of these.</p>",
  "page-299": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">But she had\nnever imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of\nthe morning star.</p><p>Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she\nreflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree\nof accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life. A fault in the\nscenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the\nstage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too\nmuch. “I will bow,” she had thought. “I will not shake hands with him.\nThat will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed—but to whom? To\ngods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls! She had bowed across\nthe rubbish that cumbers the world.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil.

Lucy\nsoothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well\nfor their married peace. No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser to\ndiscover the imperfections before wedlock. Miss Bartlett, indeed, though\nnot in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing\nsatisfactory. Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded the\nteaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.</p><p>“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter\nwith Cecil?”</p><p>The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with\ncharity and restraint.</p><p>“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.”</p><p>“Perhaps he’s tired.”</p><p>Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.</p>",

No—it is just the same thing everywhere.”</p><p>“Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?”</p><p>“Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour?”</p><p>“Cecil has a very high standard for people,” faltered Lucy, seeing\ntrouble ahead. “It’s part of his ideals—it is really that that makes\nhim sometimes seem—”</p><p>“Oh, rubbish! If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets\nrid of them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.</p>",
  "page-302": "<p>“Now, mother! I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!”</p><p>“Not in that way. At times I could wring her neck.

I had a letter from Charlotte while I was\naway in London.”</p><p>This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs.\nHoneychurch resented it.</p><p>“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him.\nWhenever I speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to\ncontradict me.

  "page-305": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">shall I do, what shall I do?” It seemed to\nher that everyone else was behaving very badly. And she ought not to\nhave mentioned Miss Bartlett’s letter.

Cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they\nimpeded Mary with her brood of hot-water cans. Then Mrs. Honeychurch\nopened her door and said: “Lucy, what a noise you’re making! I\nhave something to say to you. Did you say you had had a letter from\nCharlotte?” and Freddy ran away.</p><p>“Yes. I really can’t stop.

When she talked to\nGeorge—they met again almost immediately at the Rectory—his voice\nmoved her deeply, and she wished to remain near him. How dreadful if she\nreally wished to remain near him! Of course, the wish was due to nerves,\nwhich love to play such perverse tricks upon us.

She arrived at the London and Brighton\nstation, and had to hire a cab up. No one was at home except Freddy\nand his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for\na solid hour. Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with\nlittle Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper\nlawn for tea.</p><p>“I shall never forgive myself,” said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising\nfrom her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain.\n“I have upset everything.

I should practically be robbing the one who lost.”</p><p>“Freddy owes me fifteen shillings,” interposed Cecil. “So it will work\nout right if you give the pound to me.”</p><p>“Fifteen shillings,” said Miss Bartlett dubiously. “How is that, Mr.\nVyse?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Because, don’t you see, Freddy paid your cab. Give me the pound, and we\nshall avoid this deplorable</p>",
  "page-322": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">gambling.”</p><p>Miss Bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered\nup the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths. For\na moment Cecil was happy. He was playing at nonsense among his peers.\nThen he glanced at Lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had marred the\nsmiles. In January he would rescue his Leonardo from this stupefying\ntwaddle.</p><p>“But I don’t see that!” exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched\nthe iniquitous transaction. “I don’t see why Mr. Vyse is to have the\nquid.”</p><p>“Because of the fifteen shillings and the five,” they said solemnly.\n“Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.”</p><p>“But I don’t see—”</p><p>They tried to stifle her with cake.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“No, thank you. I’m done. I don’t see why—Freddy, don’t poke me. Miss\nHoneychurch, your brother’s</p>",

No, I don’t see and I never shall see why Miss\nWhat’s-her-name shouldn’t pay that bob for the driver.”</p><p>“I had forgotten the driver,” said Miss Bartlett, reddening. “Thank you,\ndear, for reminding me. A shilling was it? Can any one give me change\nfor half a crown?”</p><p>“I’ll get it,” said the young hostess, rising with decision.</p><p>“Cecil, give me that sovereign. No, give me up that sovereign. I’ll get\nEuphemia to change it, and we’ll start the whole thing again from the\nbeginning.”</p><p>“Lucy—Lucy—what a nuisance I am!” protested Miss Bartlett, and\nfollowed her across the lawn. Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity.\nWhen they were out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said\nquite briskly: “Have you told him about him yet?”</p>",
  "page-324": "<p>“No, I haven’t,” replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her tongue\nfor understanding so quickly what her cousin meant. “Let me see—a\nsovereign’s worth of silver.”</p><p>She escaped into the kitchen. Miss Bartlett’s sudden transitions were\ntoo uncanny. It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke\nor caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had\nbeen a ruse to surprise the soul.</p><p>“No, I haven’t told Cecil or any one,” she remarked, when she returned.\n“I promised you I shouldn’t. Here is your money—all shillings, except\ntwo half-crowns. Would you count it? You can settle your debt nicely\nnow.”</p><p>Miss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of St.\nJohn ascending, which had been framed.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“How dreadful!” she murmured, “how more than</p>",
  "page-325": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">dreadful, if Mr. Vyse\nshould come to hear of it from some other source.”</p><p>“Oh, no, Charlotte,” said the girl, entering the battle. “George Emerson\nis all right, and what other source is there?”</p><p>Miss Bartlett considered. “For instance, the driver. I saw him looking\nthrough the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.”</p><p>Lucy shuddered a little. “We shall get the silly affair on our nerves\nif we aren’t careful. How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold of\nCecil?”</p><p>“We must think of every possibility.”</p><p>“Oh, it’s all right.”</p><p>“Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows. In fact, he is certain to know.”</p><p>“I don’t care if he does. I was grateful to you for your letter, but\neven if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at\nit.”</p>",
  "page-326": "<p>“To contradict it?”</p><p>“No, to laugh at it.” But she knew in her heart that she could not trust\nhim, for he desired her untouched.</p><p>“Very well, dear, you know best. Perhaps gentlemen are different to what\nthey were when I was young. Ladies are certainly different.”</p><p>“Now, Charlotte!” She struck at her playfully. “You kind, anxious thing.\nWhat WOULD you have me do? First you say ‘Don’t tell’; and then you say,\n‘Tell’. Which is it to be? Quick!”</p><p>Miss Bartlett sighed “I am no match for you in conversation, dearest. I\nblush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able\nto look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am. You\nwill never forgive me.”</p><p>“Shall we go out, then. They will smash all the china if we don’t.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was</p>",
  "page-327": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">being scalped with\na teaspoon.</p><p>“Dear, one moment—we may not have this chance for a chat again. Have\nyou seen the young one yet?”</p><p>“Yes, I have.”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“We met at the Rectory.”</p><p>“What line is he taking up?”</p><p>“No line. He talked about Italy, like any other person. It is really all\nright. What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it bluntly?\nI do wish I could make you see it my way. He really won’t be any\nnuisance, Charlotte.”</p><p>“Once a cad, always a cad. That is my poor opinion.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lucy paused. “Cecil said one day—and I thought it so profound—that\nthere are two kinds of cads—the conscious and the subconscious.” She\npaused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil’s profundity. Through\nthe window she saw Cecil himself, turning over the</p>",
  "page-328": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">pages of a novel. It\nwas a new one from Smith’s library. Her mother must have returned from\nthe station.</p><p>“Once a cad, always a cad,” droned Miss Bartlett.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head. I fell into\nall those violets, and he was silly and surprised. I don’t think we\nought to blame him very much. It makes such a difference when you see a\nperson with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly. It really does;\nit makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn’t admire\nme, or any of that nonsense, one straw. Freddy rather likes him, and\nhas asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself. He has\nimproved; he doesn’t always look as if he’s going to burst into\ntears. He is a clerk in the General Manager’s office at one of the big\nrailways—not a porter! and runs down to his father for week-ends. Papa\nwas to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired. There!\nNow for the garden.” She took hold of her guest by the</p>",
  "page-329": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">arm. “Suppose we\ndon’t talk about this silly Italian business any more. We want you to\nhave a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.”</p><p>Lucy thought this rather a good speech. The reader may have detected\nan unfortunate slip in it. Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one\ncannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly\npeople. She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the\nentrance of her hostess. Explanations took place, and in the midst of\nthem Lucy escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her\nbrain.</p><hr class=\"section\">",
  "page-330": "<h4>Chapter Xv</h4><h3>The Disaster Within</h3><p class=\"  start-chapter\">The Sunday after Miss Bartlett’s arrival was a glorious day, like most\nof the days of that year. In the Weald, autumn approached, breaking up\nthe green monotony of summer, touching the parks with the grey bloom of\nmist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold. Up on the\nheights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves\nunchangeable. Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in\neither arose the tinkle of church bells.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except</p>",
  "page-331": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">for a red book, which\nlay sunning itself upon the gravel path. From the house came incoherent\nsounds, as of females preparing for worship. “The men say they won’t\ngo”—“Well, I don’t blame them”—Minnie says, “need she go?”—“Tell\nher, no nonsense”—“Anne! Mary! Hook me behind!”—“Dearest Lucia, may I\ntrespass upon you for a pin?” For Miss Bartlett had announced that she\nat all events was one for church.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by Phaethon, but by\nApollo, competent, unswerving, divine. Its rays fell on the ladies\nwhenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on Mr. Beebe down\nat Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan; on\nGeorge Emerson cleaning his father’s boots; and lastly, to complete the\ncatalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned previously. The\nladies move, Mr. Beebe moves, George moves, and movement may engender\nshadow. But this</p>",
  "page-332": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">book lies motionless, to be caressed all the morning\nby the sun and to raise its covers slightly, as though acknowledging the\ncaress.</p><p>Presently Lucy steps out of the drawing-room window. Her new cerise\ndress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan. At her\nthroat is a garnet brooch, on her finger a ring set with rubies—an\nengagement ring. Her eyes are bent to the Weald. She frowns a\nlittle—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not\nto cry. In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may\nfrown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo\nand the western hills.</p><p>“Lucy! Lucy! What’s that book? Who’s been taking a book out of the shelf\nand leaving it about to spoil?”</p><p>“It’s only the library book that Cecil’s been reading.”</p><p>“But pick it up, and don’t stand idling there like a flamingo.”</p>",
  "page-333": "<p>Lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly, Under a\nLoggia. She no longer read novels herself, devoting all her spare time\nto solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up. It was dreadful\nhow little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like\nthe Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it. Only this morning\nshe had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca, and Cecil\nhad said, “What! you aren’t forgetting your Italy already?” And this too\nhad lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the\ndear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely conceivable\nelsewhere, the dear sun.</p><p>“Lucy—have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself?”</p><p>She hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a\nSunday fluster.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“It’s a special collection—I forget what for.

  "page-334": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Minnie has a nice\nbright sixpence. Where is the child? Minnie! That book’s all warped.\n(Gracious, how plain you look!) Put it under the Atlas to press.\nMinnie!”</p><p>“Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch—” from the upper regions.</p><p>“Minnie, don’t be late. Here comes the horse”—it was always the horse,\nnever the carriage. “Where’s Charlotte? Run up and hurry her. Why is she\nso long? She had nothing to do. She never brings anything but blouses.\nPoor Charlotte—How I do detest blouses! Minnie!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Paganism is infectious—more infectious than diphtheria or piety—and\nthe Rector’s niece was taken to church protesting. As usual, she didn’t\nsee why. Why shouldn’t she sit in the sun with the young men? The\nyoung men, who had now appeared, mocked her with ungenerous words. Mrs.\nHoneychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion</p>",
  "page-335": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Miss\nBartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling down\nthe stairs.</p><p>“Dear Marian, I am very sorry, but I have no small change—nothing but\nsovereigns and half crowns. Could any one give me—”</p><p>“Yes, easily. Jump in. Gracious me, how smart you look! What a lovely\nfrock! You put us all to shame.”</p><p>“If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear\nthem?” said Miss Bartlett reproachfully. She got into the victoria and\nplaced herself with her back to the horse. The necessary roar ensued,\nand then they drove off.</p><p>“Good-bye! Be good!” called out Cecil.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lucy bit her lip, for the tone was sneering. On the subject of “church\nand so on” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation. He had\nsaid that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to\noverhaul herself; she did not know it was done. Honest</p>",
  "page-336": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">orthodoxy\nCecil respected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a\nspiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that\nmight grow heavenward like flowers. All that he said on this subject\npained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the\nEmersons were different.</p><p>She saw the Emersons after church. There was a line of carriages down\nthe road, and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie\nVilla. To save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father\nand son smoking in the garden.</p><p>“Introduce me,” said her mother. “Unless the young man considers that he\nknows me already.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He probably did; but Lucy ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them\nformally. Old Mr. Emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how\nglad he was that she was going to be married. She said yes, she was glad\ntoo; and then, as Miss Bartlett and Minnie</p>",
  "page-337": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">were lingering behind with\nMr. Beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic, and\nasked him how he liked his new house.</p><p>“Very much,” he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice;\nshe had never known him offended before. He added: “We find, though,\nthat the Miss Alans were coming, and that we have turned them out. Women\nmind such a thing. I am very much upset about it.”</p><p>“I believe that there was some misunderstanding,” said Mrs. Honeychurch\nuneasily.</p><p>“Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,”\n said George, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further. “He\nthought we should be artistic. He is disappointed.”</p><p>“And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to\ngive it up. What do you think?” He appealed to Lucy.</p>",
  "page-338": "<p>“Oh, stop now you have come,” said Lucy lightly. She must avoid\ncensuring Cecil. For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned,\nthough his name was never mentioned.</p><p>“So George says. He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall. Yet it\ndoes seem so unkind.”</p><p>“There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,” said George,\nwatching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.</p><p>“Yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch. “That’s exactly what I say. Why all\nthis twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain\namount of light,” he continued in measured tones. “We cast a shadow\non something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to\nplace to save things; because the shadow always follows. Choose a place\nwhere you won’t do harm—yes, choose a place</p>",
  "page-339": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">where you won’t do very\nmuch harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.”</p><p>“Oh, Mr. Emerson, I see you’re clever!”</p><p>“Eh—?”</p><p>“I see you’re going to be clever. I hope you didn’t go behaving like\nthat to poor Freddy.”</p><p>George’s eyes laughed, and Lucy suspected that he and her mother would\nget on rather well.</p><p>“No, I didn’t,” he said. “He behaved that way to me. It is his\nphilosophy. Only he starts life with it; and I have tried the Note of\nInterrogation first.”</p><p>“What DO you mean? No, never mind what you mean. Don’t explain. He looks\nforward to seeing you this afternoon. Do you play tennis? Do you mind\ntennis on Sunday—?”</p><p>“George mind tennis on Sunday! George, after his education, distinguish\nbetween Sunday—”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Very well, George doesn’t mind tennis on Sunday.</p>",
  "page-340": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">No more do I. That’s\nsettled. Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so\npleased.”</p><p>He thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter\nabout in these days.</p><p>She turned to George: “And then he wants to give up his house to the\nMiss Alans.”</p><p>“I know,” said George, and put his arm round his father’s neck. The\nkindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came\nout suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape—a touch of the\nmorning sun? She remembered that in all his perversities he had never\nspoken against affection.</p><p>Miss Bartlett approached.</p><p>“You know our cousin, Miss Bartlett,” said Mrs. Honeychurch pleasantly.\n“You met her with my daughter in Florence.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Yes, indeed!” said the old man, and made as if he would come out of the\ngarden to meet the lady. Miss</p>",
  "page-341": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Bartlett promptly got into the victoria.\nThus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow. It was the pension Bertolini\nagain, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine. It was the\nold, old battle of the room with the view.</p><p>George did not respond to the bow. Like any boy, he blushed and was\nashamed; he knew that the chaperon remembered. He said: “I—I’ll come up\nto tennis if I can manage it,” and went into the house. Perhaps anything\nthat he did would have pleased Lucy, but his awkwardness went straight\nto her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as clumsy as\ngirls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and need help. To\none of her upbringing, and of her destination, the weakness of men was a\ntruth unfamiliar, but she had surmised it at Florence, when George threw\nher photographs into the River Arno.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“George, don’t go,” cried his father, who thought it</p>",
  "page-342": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">a great treat for\npeople if his son would talk to them. “George has been in such good\nspirits today, and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.”</p><p>Lucy caught her cousin’s eye. Something in its mute appeal made her\nreckless. “Yes,” she said, raising her voice, “I do hope he will.” Then\nshe went to the carriage and murmured, “The old man hasn’t been told;\nI knew it was all right.” Mrs. Honeychurch followed her, and they drove\naway.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Satisfactory that Mr. Emerson had not been told of the Florence\nescapade; yet Lucy’s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had\nsighted the ramparts of heaven. Satisfactory; yet surely she greeted\nit with disproportionate joy. All the way home the horses’ hoofs sang a\ntune to her: “He has not told, he has not told.” Her brain expanded the\nmelody: “He has not told his father—to whom he tells all things. It was\nnot an exploit. He did not laugh at me when I had gone.” She</p>",
  "page-343": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">raised her\nhand to her cheek. “He does not love me. No. How terrible if he did! But\nhe has not told. He will not tell.”</p><p>She longed to shout the words: “It is all right. It’s a secret between\nus two for ever. Cecil will never hear.” She was even glad that Miss\nBartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at\nFlorence, when they had knelt packing in his room. The secret, big or\nlittle, was guarded.</p><p>Only three English people knew of it in the world. Thus she interpreted\nher joy. She greeted Cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so\nsafe. As he helped her out of the carriage, she said:</p><p>“The Emersons have been so nice. George Emerson has improved\nenormously.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“How are my proteges?” asked Cecil, who took no real interest in them,\nand had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy\nCorner for</p>",
  "page-344": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">educational purposes.</p><p>“Proteges!” she exclaimed with some warmth. For the only relationship\nwhich Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected. He\nhad no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned.</p><p>“You shall see for yourself how your proteges are. George Emerson is\ncoming up this afternoon. He is a most interesting man to talk to. Only\ndon’t—” She nearly said, “Don’t protect him.” But the bell was ringing\nfor lunch, and, as often happened, Cecil had paid no great attention to\nher remarks. Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lunch was a cheerful meal. Generally Lucy was depressed at meals. Some\none had to be soothed—either Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not\nvisible to the mortal eye—a Being who whispered to her soul: “It\nwill not last, this cheerfulness. In January you must go to London to\nentertain the grandchildren of celebrated</p>",
  "page-345": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">men.” But to-day she felt she\nhad received a guarantee. Her mother would always sit there, her brother\nhere. The sun, though it had moved a little since the morning, would\nnever be hidden behind the western hills. After luncheon they asked her\nto play. She had seen Gluck’s Armide that year, and played from memory\nthe music of the enchanted garden—the music to which Renaud approaches,\nbeneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never gains, never\nwanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland. Such\nmusic is not for the piano, and her audience began to get restive,\nand Cecil, sharing the discontent, called out: “Now play us the other\ngarden—the one in Parsifal.”</p><p>She closed the instrument.</p><p>“Not very dutiful,” said her mother’s voice.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Fearing that she had offended Cecil, she turned quickly round. There\nGeorge was. He had crept in</p>",
  "page-346": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">without interrupting her.</p><p>“Oh, I had no idea!” she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without\na word of greeting, she reopened the piano. Cecil should have the\nParsifal, and anything else that he liked.</p><p>“Our performer has changed her mind,” said Miss Bartlett, perhaps\nimplying, she will play the music to Mr. Emerson. Lucy did not know\nwhat to do nor even what she wanted to do. She played a few bars of the\nFlower Maidens’ song very badly and then she stopped.</p><p>“I vote tennis,” said Freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.</p><p>“Yes, so do I.” Once more she closed the unfortunate piano. “I vote you\nhave a men’s four.”</p><p>“All right.”</p><p>“Not for me, thank you,” said Cecil. “I will not spoil the set.” He\nnever realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make\nup a fourth.</p>",
  "page-347": "<p>“Oh, come along Cecil. I’m bad, Floyd’s rotten, and so I dare say’s\nEmerson.”</p><p>George corrected him: “I am not bad.”</p><p>One looked down one’s nose at this. “Then certainly I won’t play,” said\nCecil, while Miss Bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing\nGeorge, added: “I agree with you, Mr. Vyse. You had much better not\nplay. Much better not.”</p><p>Minnie, rushing in where Cecil feared to tread, announced that she would\nplay. “I shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?” But\nSunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.</p><p>“Then it will have to be Lucy,” said Mrs. Honeychurch; “you must fall\nback on Lucy. There is no other way out of it. Lucy, go and change your\nfrock.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lucy’s Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature. She kept it\nwithout hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in\nthe afternoon. As</p>",
  "page-348": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">she changed her frock, she wondered whether Cecil was\nsneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything\nup before she married him.</p><p>Mr. Floyd was her partner. She liked music, but how much better tennis\nseemed. How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit\nat the piano and feel girt under the arms. Once more music appeared to\nher the employment of a child. George served, and surprised her by his\nanxiety to win. She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at\nSanta Croce because things wouldn’t fit; how after the death of that\nobscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to\nher: “I shall want to live, I tell you.” He wanted to live now, to win\nat tennis, to stand for all he was worth in the sun—the sun which had\nbegun to decline and was shining in her eyes; and he did win.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked! The hills stood out above its\nradiance, as Fiesole stands above the</p>",
  "page-349": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Tuscan Plain, and the South Downs,\nif one chose, were the mountains of Carrara. She might be forgetting her\nItaly, but she was noticing more things in her England. One could play\na new game with the view, and try to find in its innumerable folds some\ntown or village that would do for Florence. Ah, how beautiful the Weald\nlooked!</p><p>But now Cecil claimed her. He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood,\nand would not sympathize with exaltation. He had been rather a nuisance\nall through the tennis, for the novel that he was reading was so bad\nthat he was obliged to read it aloud to others. He would stroll round\nthe precincts of the court and call out: “I say, listen to this, Lucy.\nThree split infinitives.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Dreadful!” said Lucy, and missed her stroke. When they had finished\ntheir set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and\nreally everyone must listen to it. Freddy and Mr. Floyd were obliged to\nhunt</p>",
  "page-350": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.</p><p>“The scene is laid in Florence.”</p><p>“What fun, Cecil! Read away. Come, Mr. Emerson, sit down after all your\nenergy.” She had “forgiven” George, as she put it, and she made a point\nof being pleasant to him.</p><p>He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking: “You—and are\nyou tired?”</p><p>“Of course I’m not!”</p><p>“Do you mind being beaten?”</p><p>She was going to answer, “No,” when it struck her that she did mind,\nso she answered, “Yes.” She added merrily, “I don’t see you’re such\na splendid player, though. The light was behind you, and it was in my\neyes.”</p><p>“I never said I was.”</p><p>“Why, you did!”</p>",
  "page-351": "<p>“You didn’t attend.”</p><p>“You said—oh, don’t go in for accuracy at this house. We all\nexaggerate, and we get very angry with people who don’t.”</p><p>“‘The scene is laid in Florence,’” repeated Cecil, with an upward note.</p><p>Lucy recollected herself.</p><p>“‘Sunset.

Miss Bartlett, who was thoroughly\nfrightened, took up a book and pretended to read.</p>",
  "page-372": "<p>She would not be drawn into an elaborate speech. She just said: “I can’t\nhave it, Mr. Emerson. I cannot even talk to you.

  "page-376": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">gentle and explain. I have cared\nfor you since that man died.

  "page-377": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">you understood,” he said. “I have been into the dark, and\nI am going back into it, unless you will try to understand.”</p><p>Her long, narrow head drove backwards and forwards, as though\ndemolishing some invisible obstacle.

Their tongues\nwere</p>",
  "page-378": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.</p><p>“Oh, Lucia—come back here—oh, what an awful man!”</p><p>Lucy had no reaction—at least, not yet. “Well, he amuses me,” she\nsaid. “Either I’m mad, or else he is, and I’m inclined to think it’s the\nlatter. One more fuss through with you, Charlotte. Many thanks. I think,\nthough, that this is the last. My admirer will hardly trouble me again.”</p><p>And Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish:</p><p>“Well, it isn’t everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is\nit? Oh, one oughtn’t to laugh, really. It might have been very serious.\nBut you were so sensible and brave—so unlike the girls of my day.”</p><p>“Let’s go down to them.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But, once in the open air, she paused. Some emotion—pity, terror, love,\nbut the emotion was strong—seized her, and she was aware of autumn.\nSummer was ending,</p>",
  "page-379": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and the evening brought her odours of decay, the\nmore pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring. That something or\nother mattered intellectually?

  "page-386": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">him that “little more,” his long, thoughtful\nface.</p><p>“Don’t open the window; and you’d better draw the curtain, too; Freddy\nor any one might be outside.” He obeyed. “I really think we had better\ngo to bed, if you don’t mind. I shall only say things that will make me\nunhappy afterwards. As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no good\ntalking.”</p><p>But to Cecil, now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment\nmore desirable. He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first\ntime since they were engaged. From a Leonardo she had become a living\nwoman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even\neluded art. His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of\ngenuine devotion, he cried: “But I love you, and I did think you loved\nme!”</p><p>“I did not,” she said. “I thought I did at first. I am sorry, and ought\nto have refused you this last time, too.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He began to walk up and down the room, and she</p>",
  "page-387": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">grew more and more vexed\nat his dignified behaviour. She had counted on his being petty. It would\nhave made things easier for her. By a cruel irony she was drawing out\nall that was finest in his disposition.</p><p>“You don’t love me, evidently. I dare say you are right not to. But it\nwould hurt a little less if I knew why.”</p><p>“Because”—a phrase came to her, and she accepted it—“you’re the sort\nwho can’t know any one intimately.”</p><p>A horrified look came into his eyes.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I don’t mean exactly that. But you will question me, though I beg you\nnot to, and I must say something. It is that, more or less. When we\nwere only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you’re always\nprotecting me.” Her voice swelled. “I won’t be protected. I will choose\nfor myself what is ladylike and right. To shield me is an insult. Can’t\nI be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through\nyou? A</p>",
  "page-388": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">woman’s place! You despise my mother—I know you do—because\nshe’s conventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!”—she\nrose to her feet—“conventional, Cecil, you’re that, for you may\nunderstand beautiful things, but you don’t know how to use them; and you\nwrap yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up\nme. I won’t be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are\nmore glorious, and you hide them from me. That’s why I break off my\nengagement. You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when\nyou came to people—” She stopped.</p><p>There was a pause. Then Cecil said with great emotion:</p><p>“It is true.”</p><p>“True on the whole,” she corrected, full of some vague shame.</p><p>“True, every word. It is a revelation. It is—I.”</p>",
  "page-389": "<p>“Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.”</p><p>He repeated: “‘The sort that can know no one intimately.’ It is true. I\nfell to pieces the very first day we were engaged. I behaved like a cad\nto Beebe and to your brother. You are even greater than I thought.” She\nwithdrew a step. “I’m not going to worry you. You are far too good to\nme. I shall never forget your insight; and, dear, I only blame you for\nthis: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt\nyou wouldn’t marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve. I have\nnever known you till this evening. I have just used you as a peg for\nmy silly notions of what a woman should be. But this evening you are a\ndifferent person: new thoughts—even a new voice—”</p><p>“What do you mean by a new voice?” she asked, seized with incontrollable\nanger.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I mean that a new person seems speaking through</p>",
  "page-390": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">you,” said he.</p><p>Then she lost her balance. She cried: “If you think I am in love with\nsomeone else, you are very much mistaken.”</p><p>“Of course I don’t think that. You are not that kind, Lucy.”</p><p>“Oh, yes, you do think it. It’s your old idea, the idea that has kept\nEurope back—I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men. If\na girl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: ‘Oh, she had some\none else in her mind; she hopes to get someone else.’ It’s disgusting,\nbrutal! As if a girl can’t break it off for the sake of freedom.”</p><p>He answered reverently: “I may have said that in the past. I shall never\nsay it again. You have taught me better.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again. “Of\ncourse, there is no question of</p>",
  "page-391": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">‘someone else’ in this, no ‘jilting’ or\nany such nauseous stupidity. I beg your pardon most humbly if my words\nsuggested that there was. I only meant that there was a force in you\nthat I hadn’t known of up till now.”</p><p>“All right, Cecil, that will do. Don’t apologize to me. It was my\nmistake.”</p><p>“It is a question between ideals, yours and mine—pure abstract ideals,\nand yours are the nobler. I was bound up in the old vicious notions,\nand all the time you were splendid and new.” His voice broke. “I must\nactually thank you for what you have done—for showing me what I really\nam. Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman. Will you shake\nhands?”</p><p>“Of course I will,” said Lucy, twisting up her other hand in the\ncurtains. “Good-night, Cecil. Good-bye. That’s all right. I’m sorry\nabout it. Thank you very much for your gentleness.”</p><p>“Let me light your candle, shall I?”</p>",
  "page-392": "<p>They went into the hall.</p><p>“Thank you. Good-night again.

On the landing he paused\nstrong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty. For\nall his culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his love\nbecame him like the leaving of it.</p><p>She could never marry. In the tumult of her soul, that stood firm. Cecil\nbelieved in her; she must some day believe in herself. She must be one\nof the women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for liberty\nand not for men; she must forget that George loved her, that George had\nbeen thinking through her and gained her this honourable release, that\nGeorge had gone away into—what was it?—the darkness.</p>",
  "page-393": "<p>She put out the lamp.</p><p>It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel.

The armies are full of pleasant and pious folk. But they\nhave yielded to the only enemy that matters—the enemy within. They have\nsinned against passion and truth, and vain will be their strife after\nvirtue. As the years pass, they are censured. Their pleasantry and\ntheir piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism, their unselfishness\nhypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go.

On either side of it was a shallow ravine,\nfilled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the left ran\nthe highway into the Weald.</p>",
  "page-396": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Whenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble\ndispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy\nCorner,—he laughed. The situation was so glorious, the house so\ncommonplace, not to say impertinent. The late Mr. Honeychurch had\naffected the cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his\nmoney, and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret,\nshaped like a rhinoceros’ horn, where she could sit in wet weather and\nwatch the carts going up and down the road. So impertinent—and yet the\nhouse “did,” for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings\nhonestly. Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive\narchitects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all\nthese suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy Corner seemed\nas inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation. One might laugh\nat the house,</p>",
  "page-397": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">but one never shuddered. Mr. Beebe was bicycling over\nthis Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip. He had heard from the Miss\nAlans. These admirable ladies, since they could not go to Cissie Villa,\nhad changed their plans. They were going to Greece instead.</p><p>“Since Florence did my poor sister so much good,” wrote Miss Catharine,\n“we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter. Of course,\nAthens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive\nbread; but, after all, we can take that with us, and it is only getting\nfirst into a steamer and then into a train. But is there an English\nChurch?” And the letter went on to say: “I do not expect we shall go any\nfurther than Athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at\nConstantinople, we should be so grateful.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which Mr. Beebe greeted\nWindy Corner was partly for her. She would see the fun of it, and some\nof its beauty,</p>",
  "page-398": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">for she must see some beauty. Though she was hopeless\nabout pictures, and though she dressed so unevenly—oh, that cerise\nfrock yesterday at church!—she must see some beauty in life, or she\ncould not play the piano as she did. He had a theory that musicians are\nincredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they want\nand what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends;\nthat their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet been\nunderstood. This theory, had he known it, had possibly just been\nillustrated by facts. Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only\nriding over to get some tea, to see his niece, and to observe whether\nMiss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies\nto visit Athens.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he caught\nsight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped abruptly\nwhen it reached the</p>",
  "page-399": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">main road. Therefore it must be the horse, who\nalways expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him. The\ndoor opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom Mr. Beebe recognized\nas Cecil and Freddy. They were an odd couple to go driving; but he saw\na trunk beside the coachman’s legs. Cecil, who wore a bowler, must be\ngoing away, while Freddy (a cap)—was seeing him to the station. They\nwalked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the summit while the\ncarriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.</p><p>They shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.</p><p>“So you’re off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?” he asked.</p><p>Cecil said, “Yes,” while Freddy edged away.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends\nof Miss Honeychurch.” He quoted from it. “Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it\nromance? Most certainly they will go to Constantinople. They are</p>",
  "page-400": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">taken\nin a snare that cannot fail. They will end by going round the world.”</p><p>Cecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that Lucy would be amused\nand interested.</p><p>“Isn’t Romance capricious! I never notice it in you young people; you\ndo nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while the\nMiss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the\nterrible thing. ‘A really comfortable pension at Constantinople!’ So\nthey call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension\nwith magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland\nforlorn! No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans. They want the\nPension Keats.”</p><p>“I’m awfully sorry to interrupt, Mr. Beebe,” said Freddy, “but have you\nany matches?”</p><p>“I have,” said Cecil, and it did not escape Mr. Beebe’s notice that he\nspoke to the boy more kindly.</p>",
  "page-401": "<p>“You have never met these Miss Alans, have you, Mr. Vyse?”</p><p>“Never.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Then you don’t see the wonder of this Greek visit. I haven’t been\nto Greece myself, and don’t mean to go, and I can’t imagine any of my\nfriends going. It is altogether too big for our little lot. Don’t you\nthink so? Italy is just about as much as we can manage. Italy is heroic,\nbut Greece is godlike or devilish—I am not sure which, and in either\ncase absolutely out of our suburban focus. All right, Freddy—I am\nnot being clever, upon my word I am not—I took the idea from another\nfellow; and give me those matches when you’ve done with them.” He lit a\ncigarette, and went on talking to the two young men. “I was saying, if\nour poor little Cockney lives must have a background, let it be Italian.\nBig enough in all conscience. The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for\nme. There the contrast is just as much as I</p>",
  "page-402": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">can realize. But not the\nParthenon, not the frieze of Phidias at any price; and here comes the\nvictoria.”</p><p>“You’re quite right,” said Cecil. “Greece is not for our little lot”;\nand he got in. Freddy followed, nodding to the clergyman, whom he\ntrusted not to be pulling one’s leg, really. And before they had gone a\ndozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for Vyse’s match-box,\nwhich had not been returned. As he took it, he said: “I’m so glad you\nonly talked about books. Cecil’s hard hit. Lucy won’t marry him. If\nyou’d gone on about her, as you did about them, he might have broken\ndown.”</p><p>“But when—”</p><p>“Late last night.

  "page-403": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the one foolish thing she ever\ndid. Oh, what a glorious riddance!” And, after a little thought, he\nnegotiated the slope into Windy Corner, light of heart. The house was\nagain as it ought to be—cut off forever from Cecil’s pretentious world.</p><p>He would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.</p><p>In the drawing-room Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata. He hesitated a\nmoment, but went down the garden as requested. There he found a mournful\ncompany. It was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and broken the\ndahlias. Mrs. Honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them up,\nwhile Miss Bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of\nassistance. At a little distance stood Minnie and the “garden-child,” a\nminute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Beebe? Gracious what a mess everything is! Look\nat my scarlet pompoms, and</p>",
  "page-404": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the wind blowing your skirts about, and the\nground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage\nhaving to go out, when I had counted on having Powell, who—give every\none their due—does tie up dahlias properly.”</p><p>Evidently Mrs. Honeychurch was shattered.</p><p>“How do you do?” said Miss Bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though\nconveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn\ngales.</p><p>“Here, Lennie, the bass,” cried Mrs. Honeychurch. The garden-child, who\ndid not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror. Minnie\nslipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable\nto-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings would tear\nlongways instead of across.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Come for a walk with me,” he told her. “You have worried them as much\nas they can stand. Mrs. Honeychurch, I only called in aimlessly. I shall\ntake her</p>",
  "page-405": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may.”</p><p>“Oh, must you? Yes do.—Not the scissors, thank you, Charlotte, when\nboth my hands are full already—I’m perfectly certain that the orange\ncactus will go before I can get to it.”</p><p>Mr. Beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited Miss\nBartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.</p><p>“Yes, Charlotte, I don’t want you—do go; there’s nothing to stop about\nfor, either in the house or out of it.”</p><p>Miss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she had\nexasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she turned round and\nexasperated Minnie by an acceptance. As they walked up the garden, the\norange cactus fell, and Mr. Beebe’s last vision was of the garden-child\nclasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom.</p>",
  "page-406": "<p>“It is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,” he remarked.</p><p>“It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a\nmoment,” enunciated Miss Bartlett.</p><p>“Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother. Or will\nshe come with us?”</p><p>“I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.”</p><p>“They’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for\nbreakfast,” whispered Minnie, “and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has\ngone, and Freddy won’t play with me. In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house is\nnot AT ALL what it was yesterday.”</p><p>“Don’t be a prig,” said her Uncle Arthur. “Go and put on your boots.”</p><p>He stepped into the drawing-room, where Lucy was still attentively\npursuing the Sonatas of Mozart. She stopped when he entered.</p>",
  "page-407": "<p>“How do you do? Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at\nthe Beehive. Would you come too?”</p><p>“I don’t think I will, thank you.”</p><p>“No, I didn’t suppose you would care to much.”</p><p>Lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.</p><p>“How delicate those Sonatas are!” said Mr. Beebe, though at the bottom\nof his heart, he thought them silly little things.</p><p>Lucy passed into Schumann.</p><p>“Miss Honeychurch!”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I met them on the hill. Your brother told me.”</p><p>“Oh he did?” She sounded annoyed. Mr. Beebe felt hurt, for he had\nthought that she would like him to be told.</p><p>“I needn’t say that it will go no further.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Mother, Charlotte, Cecil, Freddy, you,” said Lucy,</p>",
  "page-408": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">playing a note for\neach person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.</p><p>“If you’ll let me say so, I am very glad, and I am certain that you have\ndone the right thing.”</p><p>“So I hoped other people would think, but they don’t seem to.”</p><p>“I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise.”</p><p>“So does mother. Mother minds dreadfully.”</p><p>“I am very sorry for that,” said Mr. Beebe with feeling.</p><p>Mrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as\nmuch as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute. It was really\na ruse of Lucy’s to justify her despondency—a ruse of which she was not\nherself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.</p><p>“And Freddy minds.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Still, Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much, did</p>",
  "page-409": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he? I gathered that\nhe disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.”</p><p>“Boys are so odd.”</p><p>Minnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor. Tea\nat the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel. Mr.\nBeebe saw that Lucy—very properly—did not wish to discuss her action,\nso after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, “I have had an\nabsurd letter from Miss Alan. That was really what brought me over. I\nthought it might amuse you all.”</p><p>“How delightful!” said Lucy, in a dull voice.</p><p>For the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter. After\na few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with\n“Going abroad? When do they start?”</p><p>“Next week, I gather.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight</p>",
  "page-410": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">back?”</p><p>“No, he didn’t.”</p><p>“Because I do hope he won’t go gossiping.”</p><p>So she did want to talk about her broken engagement. Always complaisant,\nhe put the letter away. But she, at once exclaimed in a high voice, “Oh,\ndo tell me more about the Miss Alans! How perfectly splendid of them to\ngo abroad!”</p><p>“I want them to start from Venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the\nIllyrian coast!”</p><p>She laughed heartily. “Oh, delightful! I wish they’d take me.”</p><p>“Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel? Perhaps George Emerson\nis right. He says that ‘Italy is only an euphuism for Fate.’”</p><p>“Oh, not Italy, but Constantinople. I have always longed to go to\nConstantinople. Constantinople is practically Asia, isn’t it?”</p>",
  "page-411": "<p>Mr. Beebe reminded her that Constantinople was still unlikely, and that\nthe Miss Alans only aimed at Athens, “with Delphi, perhaps, if the roads\nare safe.” But this made no difference to her enthusiasm. She had always\nlonged to go to Greece even more, it seemed. He saw, to his surprise,\nthat she was apparently serious.</p><p>“I didn’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends,\nafter Cissie Villa.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s nothing; I assure you Cissie Villa’s nothing to me; I would\ngive anything to go with them.”</p><p>“Would your mother spare you again so soon? You have scarcely been home\nthree months.”</p><p>“She MUST spare me!” cried Lucy, in growing excitement. “I simply MUST\ngo away. I have to.” She ran her fingers hysterically through her hair.\n“Don’t you see that I HAVE to go away? I didn’t realize at the time—and\nof course I want to see Constantinople so particularly.”</p>",
  "page-412": "<p>“You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel—”</p><p>“Yes, yes. I knew you’d understand.”</p><p>Mr. Beebe did not quite understand. Why could not Miss Honeychurch\nrepose in the bosom of her family? Cecil had evidently taken up the\ndignified line, and was not going to annoy her. Then it struck him that\nher family itself might be annoying. He hinted this to her, and she\naccepted the hint eagerly.</p><p>“Yes, of course; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea\nand everything has calmed down.”</p><p>“I am afraid it has been a bothersome business,” he said gently.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“No, not at all.

He would\nimprove me in places where I can’t be improved. Cecil won’t let a</p>",
  "page-413": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">woman\ndecide for herself—in fact, he daren’t. What nonsense I do talk! But\nthat is the kind of thing.”</p><p>“It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse; it is what I\ngather from all that I have known of you. I do sympathize and agree\nmost profoundly. I agree so much that you must let me make one little\ncriticism: Is it worth while rushing off to Greece?”</p><p>“But I must go somewhere!” she cried. “I have been worrying all the\nmorning, and here comes the very thing.” She struck her knees with\nclenched fists, and repeated: “I must! And the time I shall have with\nmother, and all the money she spent on me last spring. You all think\nmuch too highly of me. I wish you weren’t so kind.” At this moment Miss\nBartlett entered, and her nervousness increased. “I must get away, ever\nso far. I must know my own mind and where I want to go.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Come along; tea, tea, tea,” said Mr. Beebe, and bustled his guests out\nof the front-door. He hustled</p>",
  "page-414": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">them so quickly that he forgot his hat.\nWhen he returned for it he heard, to his relief and surprise, the\ntinkling of a Mozart Sonata.</p><p>“She is playing again,” he said to Miss Bartlett.</p><p>“Lucy can always play,” was the acid reply.</p><p>“One is very thankful that she has such a resource. She is evidently\nmuch worried, as, of course, she ought to be. I know all about it. The\nmarriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she\ncould wind herself up to speak.”</p><p>Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.\nHe had never fathomed Miss Bartlett. As he had put it to himself\nat Florence, “she might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of\nmeaning.” But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable. He\nassumed that much, and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with her.\nMinnie was fortunately collecting ferns.</p>",
  "page-415": "<p>She opened the discussion with: “We had much better let the matter\ndrop.”</p><p>“I wonder.”</p><p>“It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in\nSummer Street. It would be DEATH to gossip about Mr. Vyse’s dismissal at\nthe present moment.”</p><p>Mr. Beebe raised his eyebrows. Death is a strong word—surely too\nstrong. There was no question of tragedy. He said: “Of course, Miss\nHoneychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she\nchooses. Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.”</p><p>“I know,” said Miss Bartlett civilly. “Yet Freddy ought not to have told\neven you. One cannot be too careful.”</p><p>“Quite so.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I do implore absolute secrecy. A chance word to a</p>",

A rector lives in a web of petty\nsecrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is the less he\nwill regard them. He will change the subject, as did Mr. Beebe, saying\ncheerfully: “Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately? I believe\nyou keep up with Miss Lavish. It is odd how we of that pension,\nwho seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one\nanother’s lives. Two, three, four, six of us—no, eight; I had forgotten\nthe Emersons—have kept more or less in touch.

Summer was retreating. The wind roared,\nthe trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast\noperations in heaven. The weather was breaking up, breaking, broken,\nand it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips\nsuch crises with the salvos of angelic artillery. Mr. Beebe’s eyes\nrested on Windy Corner, where Lucy sat, practising Mozart. No smile came\nto his lips, and, changing the subject again, he said: “We shan’t have\nrain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on. The darkness last\nnight was appalling.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five o’clock.

  "page-418": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant\nsanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably. Mr. Beebe saw that\nMiss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that Minnie would be\ndull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces. They would hand\nthe child her food through the window. Thus he was incidentally enabled\nto discuss the fortunes of Lucy.</p><p>“I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett,” he said, “and, unless you\nvery much object, I would like to reopen that discussion.” She bowed.\n“Nothing about the past. I know little and care less about that; I am\nabsolutely certain that it is to your cousin’s credit. She has acted\nloftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we\nthink too highly of her. But the future. Seriously, what do you think of\nthis Greek plan?” He pulled out the letter again. “I don’t know whether\nyou overheard, but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career.\nIt’s all—I can’t explain—it’s wrong.”</p>",
  "page-419": "<p>Miss Bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to\nhesitate, and then read it again.</p><p>“I can’t see the point of it myself.”</p><p>To his astonishment, she replied: “There I cannot agree with you. In it\nI spy Lucy’s salvation.”</p><p>“Really. Now, why?”</p><p>“She wanted to leave Windy Corner.”</p><p>“I know—but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so—I was going to\nsay—selfish.”</p><p>“It is natural, surely—after such painful scenes—that she should\ndesire a change.”</p><p>Here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect\nmisses. Mr. Beebe exclaimed: “So she says herself, and since another\nlady agrees with her, I must own that I am partially convinced. Perhaps\nshe must have a change. I have no sisters or—and I don’t understand\nthese things. But why need she go as far as Greece?”</p>",
  "page-420": "<p>“You may well ask that,” replied Miss Bartlett, who was evidently\ninterested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner. “Why Greece?\n(What is it, Minnie dear—jam?) Why not Tunbridge Wells? Oh, Mr. Beebe!\nI had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this\nmorning. I cannot help her. I will say no more. Perhaps I have already\nsaid too much. I am not to talk. I wanted her to spend six months with\nme at Tunbridge Wells, and she refused.”</p><p>Mr. Beebe poked at a crumb with his knife.</p><p>“But my feelings are of no importance. I know too well that I get on\nLucy’s nerves. Our tour was a failure. She wanted to leave Florence, and\nwhen we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome, and all the time I\nfelt that I was spending her mother’s money—.”</p><p>“Let us keep to the future, though,” interrupted Mr. Beebe. “I want your\nadvice.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Very well,” said Charlotte, with a choky abruptness</p>",
  "page-421": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that was new to\nhim, though familiar to Lucy. “I for one will help her to go to Greece.\nWill you?”</p><p>Mr. Beebe considered.</p><p>“It is absolutely necessary,” she continued, lowering her veil and\nwhispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him.\n“I know—I know.” The darkness was coming on, and he felt that this odd\nwoman really did know. “She must not stop here a moment, and we must\nkeep quiet till she goes. I trust that the servants know nothing.\nAfterwards—but I may have said too much already. Only, Lucy and I are\nhelpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone. If you help we may succeed.\nOtherwise—”</p><p>“Otherwise—?”</p><p>“Otherwise,” she repeated as if the word held finality.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Yes, I will help her,” said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm. “Come,\nlet us go back now, and settle the</p>",
  "page-422": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">whole thing up.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Miss Bartlett burst into florid gratitude. The tavern sign—a beehive\ntrimmed evenly with bees—creaked in the wind outside as she thanked\nhim. Mr. Beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did\nnot desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of “another\nman” that would have attracted a grosser mind. He only felt that Miss\nBartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be\ndelivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form. Its very\nvagueness spurred him into knight-errantry. His belief in celibacy, so\nreticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture, now\ncame to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower. “They that\nmarry do well, but they that refrain do better.” So ran his belief,\nand he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight\nfeeling of pleasure. In the case of Lucy, the feeling was</p>",
  "page-423": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">intensified\nthrough dislike of Cecil; and he was willing to go further—to place her\nout of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity. The\nfeeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic, and he never imparted it\nto any other of the characters in this entanglement. Yet it existed,\nand it alone explains his action subsequently, and his influence on the\naction of others. The compact that he made with Miss Bartlett in the\ntavern, was to help not only Lucy, but religion also.</p><p>They hurried home through a world of black and grey. He conversed on\nindifferent topics: the Emersons’ need of a housekeeper; servants;\nItalian servants; novels about Italy; novels with a purpose; could\nliterature influence life? Windy Corner glimmered. In the garden, Mrs.\nHoneychurch, now helped by Freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her\nflowers.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“It gets too dark,” she said hopelessly. “This comes of putting off. We\nmight have known the weather</p>",
  "page-424": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">would break up soon; and now Lucy wants to\ngo to Greece. I don’t know what the world’s coming to.”</p><p>“Mrs. Honeychurch,” he said, “go to Greece she must. Come up to the\nhouse and let’s talk it over. Do you, in the first place, mind her\nbreaking with Vyse?”</p><p>“Mr. Beebe, I’m thankful—simply thankful.”</p><p>“So am I,” said Freddy.</p><p>“Good. Now come up to the house.”</p><p>They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone. It was expensive\nand dramatic—both qualities that her mother loathed. Nor would\nCharlotte have succeeded. The honours of the day rested with Mr. Beebe.\nBy his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman—for\na clergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs. Honeychurch greatly—he\nbent her to their purpose, “I don’t see why Greece is necessary,” she\nsaid; “but as you do, I suppose it is all</p>",
  "page-425": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">right. It must be something I\ncan’t understand. Lucy! Let’s tell her. Lucy!”</p><p>“She is playing the piano,” Mr. Beebe said. He opened the door, and\nheard the words of a song:</p><pre><code> “Look not thou on beauty’s charming.”</code></pre><p>“I didn’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang, too.”</p><p>“Sit thou still when kings are arming,\n   Taste not when the wine-cup glistens—”</p><p>“It’s a song that Cecil gave her. How odd girls are!”</p><p>“What’s that?” called Lucy, stopping short.</p><p>“All right, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch kindly. She went into the\ndrawing-room, and Mr. Beebe heard her kiss Lucy and say: “I am sorry I\nwas so cross about Greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.”</p><p>Rather a hard voice said: “Thank you, mother; that doesn’t matter a\nbit.”</p><p>“And you are right, too—Greece will be all right; you can go if the\nMiss Alans will have you.”</p>",
  "page-426": "<p>“Oh, splendid! Oh, thank you!”</p><p>Mr. Beebe followed. Lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the\nkeys. She was glad, but he had expected greater gladness. Her mother\nbent over her. Freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the\nfloor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.\nOddly enough, the group was beautiful. Mr. Beebe, who loved the art of\nthe past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the Santa Conversazione,\nin which people who care for one another are painted chatting together\nabout noble things—a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and\ntherefore ignored by the art of to-day. Why should Lucy want either to\nmarry or to travel when she had such friends at home?</p><p>“Taste not when the wine-cup glistens,\n   Speak not when the people listens,”</p><p>she continued.</p>",
  "page-427": "<p>“Here’s Mr. Beebe.”</p><p>“Mr. Beebe knows my rude ways.”</p><p>“It’s a beautiful song and a wise one,” said he. “Go on.”</p><p>“It isn’t very good,” she said listlessly. “I forget why—harmony or\nsomething.”</p><p>“I suspected it was unscholarly. It’s so beautiful.”</p><p>“The tune’s right enough,” said Freddy, “but the words are rotten. Why\nthrow up the sponge?”</p><p>“How stupidly you talk!” said his sister. The Santa Conversazione was\nbroken up. After all, there was no reason that Lucy should talk about\nGreece or thank him for persuading her mother, so he said good-bye.</p><p>Freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual\nfelicity of phrase, said: “This has been a day and a half.”</p><pre><code>“Stop thine ear against the singer—”</code></pre><p>“Wait a minute; she is finishing.”</p>",
  "page-428": "<p>“From the red gold keep thy finger;\n    Vacant heart and hand and eye\n    Easy live and quiet die.”</p><p>“I love weather like this,” said Freddy.</p><p>Mr. Beebe passed into it.</p><p>The two main facts were clear. She had behaved splendidly, and he had\nhelped her. He could not expect to master the details of so big a change\nin a girl’s life. If here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled, he\nmust acquiesce; she was choosing the better part.</p><p>“Vacant heart and hand and eye—”</p><p>Perhaps the song stated “the better part” rather too strongly. He half\nfancied that the soaring accompaniment—which he did not lose in the\nshout of the gale—really agreed with Freddy, and was gently criticizing\nthe words that it adorned:</p><p>“Vacant heart and hand and eye\n   Easy live and quiet die.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">However, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay</p>",

Miss\nHoneychurch, they trusted, would take care to equip herself duly.\nQuinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help\ntowards freshening up one’s face in the train. Lucy promised, a little\ndepressed.</p><p>“But, of course, you know all about these things, and you have Mr. Vyse\nto help you. A gentleman is such a stand-by.”</p><p>Mrs. Honeychurch, who had come up to town with her daughter, began to\ndrum nervously upon her card-case.</p><p>“We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you,” Miss Catharine\ncontinued. “It is not every young man who would be so unselfish.

How funny! I should have thought that in this case—”</p><p>“Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren’t going? It is such a pleasure to have\nmet you!”</p><p>They escaped, and Lucy said with relief: “That’s all right. We just got\nthrough that time.”</p><p>But her mother was annoyed. “I should be told, dear, that I am\nunsympathetic. But I cannot see why you didn’t tell your friends about\nCecil and be done with it. There all the time we had to sit fencing, and\nalmost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is most\nunpleasant.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lucy had plenty to say in reply. She described the Miss Alans’\ncharacter: they were such gossips, and if</p>",
  "page-433": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">one told them, the news would\nbe everywhere in no time.</p><p>“But why shouldn’t it be everywhere in no time?”</p><p>“Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England. I\nshall tell them then. It’s much pleasanter. How wet it is! Let’s turn in\nhere.”</p><p>“Here” was the British Museum. Mrs. Honeychurch refused. If they must\ntake shelter, let it be in a shop. Lucy felt contemptuous, for she was\non the tack of caring for Greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a\nmythical dictionary from Mr. Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses\nand gods.</p><p>“Oh, well, let it be shop, then.

  "page-434": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">gone, though I did feel angry for the minute. But why not\nannounce it? Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?”</p><p>“It’s only for a few days.”</p><p>“But why at all?”</p><p>Lucy was silent. She was drifting away from her mother. It was quite\neasy to say, “Because George Emerson has been bothering me, and if he\nhears I’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite easy, and it had\nthe incidental advantage of being true. But she could not say it. She\ndisliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that\nking of terrors—Light. Ever since that last evening at Florence she had\ndeemed it unwise to reveal her soul.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mrs. Honeychurch, too, was silent. She was thinking, “My daughter won’t\nanswer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than\nwith Freddy and me.

  "page-435": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">thoughts never remained unspoken\nlong, she burst out with: “You’re tired of Windy Corner.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This was perfectly true.

It might exist for Freddy, who still lived and thought straight,\nbut not for one who had deliberately warped the brain.

She only felt, “I do not love George; I broke off my engagement\nbecause I did not love George; I must go to Greece because I do not\nlove George; it is more important that I should look up gods in the\ndictionary than that I should help my mother; everyone else is behaving\nvery badly.” She only felt irritable and petulant, and anxious to do\nwhat she was not expected to do, and in this spirit she proceeded with\nthe</p>",
  "page-436": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">conversation.</p><p>“Oh, mother, what rubbish you talk! Of course I’m not tired of Windy\nCorner.”</p><p>“Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?”</p><p>She laughed faintly, “Half a minute would be nearer.”</p><p>“Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?”</p><p>“Hush, mother! People will hear you”; for they had entered Mudie’s. She\nbought Baedeker, and then continued: “Of course I want to live at home;\nbut as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to\nbe away in the future more than I have been. You see, I come into my\nmoney next year.”</p><p>Tears came into her mother’s eyes.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed\n“eccentricity,” Lucy determined to</p>",
  "page-437": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">make this point clear. “I’ve seen the\nworld so little—I felt so out of things in Italy. I have seen so little\nof life; one ought to come up to London more—not a cheap ticket like\nto-day, but to stop. I might even share a flat for a little with some\nother girl.”</p><p>“And mess with typewriters and latch-keys,” exploded Mrs. Honeychurch.\n“And agitate and scream, and be carried off kicking by the police. And\ncall it a Mission—when no one wants you! And call it Duty—when\nit means that you can’t stand your own home! And call it Work—when\nthousands of men are starving with the competition as it is! And then\nto prepare yourself, find two doddering old ladies, and go abroad with\nthem.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I want more independence,” said Lucy lamely; she knew that she wanted\nsomething, and independence is a useful cry; we can always say that we\nhave not got it. She tried to remember her emotions in Florence: those\nhad</p>",
  "page-438": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">been sincere and passionate, and had suggested beauty rather than\nshort skirts and latch-keys. But independence was certainly her cue.</p><p>“Very well. Take your independence and be gone. Rush up and down and\nround the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food.\nDespise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted,\nand our dear view—and then share a flat with another girl.”</p><p>Lucy screwed up her mouth and said: “Perhaps I spoke hastily.”</p><p>“Oh, goodness!” her mother flashed. “How you do remind me of Charlotte\nBartlett!”</p><p>“Charlotte!” flashed Lucy in her turn, pierced at last by a vivid pain.</p><p>“More every moment.”</p><p>“I don’t know what you mean, mother; Charlotte and I are not the very\nleast alike.”</p>",
  "page-439": "<p>“Well, I see the likeness. The same eternal worrying, the same taking\nback of words.

For\nthey were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street, where she had been\ndropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on Mr. Beebe’s old\nmother. “We shall have to sit three a side, because the trees drop, and\nyet it isn’t raining. Oh, for a little air!” Then she listened to the\nhorse’s hoofs—“He has not told—he has not told.” That melody was\nblurred by the soft road. “CAN’T we have the hood down?” she demanded,\nand her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: “Very well, old lady, stop\nthe horse.” And the horse was stopped, and Lucy and Powell wrestled with\nthe</p>",
  "page-441": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">hood, and squirted water down Mrs. Honeychurch’s neck. But now\nthat the hood was down, she did see something that she would have\nmissed—there were no lights in the windows of Cissie Villa, and round\nthe garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock.</p><p>“Is that house to let again, Powell?” she called.</p><p>“Yes, miss,” he replied.</p><p>“Have they gone?”</p><p>“It is too far out of town for the young gentleman, and his father’s\nrheumatism has come on, so he can’t stop on alone, so they are trying to\nlet furnished,” was the answer.</p><p>“They have gone, then?”</p><p>“Yes, miss, they have gone.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lucy sank back. The carriage stopped at the Rectory. She got out to call\nfor Miss Bartlett. So the Emersons had gone, and all this bother about\nGreece had been unnecessary. Waste! That word seemed to sum up the</p>",
  "page-442": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">whole\nof life. Wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she had wounded\nher mother. Was it possible that she had muddled things away? Quite\npossible. Other people had. When the maid opened the door, she was\nunable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.</p><p>Miss Bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked\na great favour: might she go to church?

The church was invisible, but up in the\ndarkness to the left there was a hint of colour. This was a stained\nwindow, through which</p>",
  "page-443": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">some feeble light was shining, and when the door\nopened Lucy heard Mr. Beebe’s voice running through the litany to a\nminute congregation. Even their church, built upon the slope of the hill\nso artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery\nshingle—even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never\ntalked about—religion—was fading like all the other things.</p><p>She followed the maid into the Rectory.</p><p>Would she object to sitting in Mr. Beebe’s study?

To George, to Cecil,\nshe would have lied again; but he seemed so near the end of things, so\ndignified in his approach to the gulf, of which he gave one account, and\nthe books that surrounded him another, so mild to the rough paths that\nhe had traversed, that the true chivalry—not the worn-out chivalry\nof sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the\nold—awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that Cecil was\nnot her companion to Greece. And she spoke so seriously that the risk\nbecame a certainty, and he, lifting his eyes, said: “You are leaving\nhim? You are leaving the man you love?”</p><p>“I—I had to.”</p>",
  "page-455": "<p>“Why, Miss Honeychurch, why?”</p><p>Terror came over her, and she lied again.

He heard her in\nsilence, and then said: “My dear, I am worried about you.

We can help one another but little. I\nused to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know\nbetter now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware\nof muddle.

  "page-456": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">pretended to be\nannoyed with me and weren’t? Do you remember before, when you refused\nthe room with the view? Those were muddles—little, but ominous—and I\nam fearing that you are in one now.” She was silent. “Don’t trust me,\nMiss Honeychurch. Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.”\n She was still silent. “‘Life’ wrote a friend of mine, ‘is a public\nperformance on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you\ngo along.’ I think he puts it well. Man has to pick up the use of his\nfunctions as he goes along—especially the function of Love.” Then he\nburst out excitedly; “That’s it; that’s what I mean. You love George!”\n And after his long preamble, the three words burst against Lucy like\nwaves from the open sea.</p><p>“But you do,” he went on, not waiting for contradiction. “You love the\nboy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other word\nexpresses it. You won’t marry the other man for his sake.”</p>",
  "page-457": "<p>“How dare you!” gasped Lucy, with the roaring of waters in her ears.\n“Oh, how like a man!—I mean, to suppose that a woman is always thinking\nabout a man.”</p><p>“But you are.”</p><p>She summoned physical disgust.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“You’re shocked, but I mean to shock you.

I know that, with George, you will find them, and\nthat you love him. Then be his wife. He is already part of you. Though\nyou fly to Greece, and never see him again, or forget his very name,\nGeorge will work in your thoughts till you die. It isn’t possible to\nlove and to part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love,\nignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by\nexperience</p>",
  "page-458": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that the poets are right: love is eternal.”</p><p>Lucy began to cry with anger, and though her anger passed away soon, her\ntears remained.</p><p>“I only wish poets would say this, too: love is of the body; not\nthe body, but of the body. Ah! the misery that would be saved if we\nconfessed that! Ah! for a little directness to liberate the soul! Your\nsoul, dear Lucy! I hate the word now, because of all the cant with which\nsuperstition has wrapped it round. But we have souls. I cannot say how\nthey came nor whither they go, but we have them, and I see you ruining\nyours. I cannot bear it. It is again the darkness creeping in; it\nis hell.” Then he checked himself. “What nonsense I have talked—how\nabstract and remote! And I have made you cry! Dear girl, forgive my\nprosiness; marry my boy. When I think what life is, and how seldom love\nis answered by love—Marry him; it is one of the moments for which the\nworld was made.”</p>",
  "page-459": "<p>She could not understand him; the words were indeed remote.

I must suffer and grow old away from him. I cannot break the\nwhole of life for his sake. They trusted me.”</p><p>A carriage drew up at the front-door.</p><p>“Give George my love—once only.

To whom do you refer? Trust whom?”</p><p>“I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George. They have\nloved one another all along.”</p><p>Mr. Beebe looked at the sobbing girl.
