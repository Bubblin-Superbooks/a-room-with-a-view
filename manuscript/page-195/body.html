was affected, sentimental, bombastic—all the things she hated most.
Why could she not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room;
looking very cross and almost handsome?</p><p>“I say, Lucy!” called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.</p><p>Lucy rose from the seat. She moved across the lawn and smiled in at
them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis. Then she saw
her brother’s face. Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms. He
said, “Steady on!”</p><p>“Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother.</p><p>Lucy kissed her also.</p><p>“Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about
it?” Cecil suggested. “And I’d stop here and tell my mother.”</p><p>“We go with Lucy?” said Freddy, as if taking orders.</p></div> </div>
