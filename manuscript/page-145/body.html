his diminutive stature?”</p><p>“The Lord knows. Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the poet.
He wrote a line—so I heard yesterday—which runs like this: ‘Don’t go
fighting against the Spring.’”</p><p>Mr. Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.</p><p>“Non fate guerra al Maggio,” he murmured. “‘War not with the May’ would
render a correct meaning.”</p><p>“The point is, we have warred with it. Look.” He pointed to the Val
d’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.
“Fifty miles of Spring, and we’ve come up to admire them. Do you suppose
there’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man? But
there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as improper,
ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.”</p></div> </div>
