heart and soul. They continued to pack in silence.</p><p>“I have been a failure,” said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the
straps of Lucy’s trunk instead of strapping her own. “Failed to make you
happy; failed in my duty to your mother. She has been so generous to me;
I shall never face her again after this disaster.”</p><p>“But mother will understand. It is not your fault, this trouble, and it
isn’t a disaster either.”</p><p>“It is my fault, it is a disaster. She will never forgive me, and
rightly. For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss
Lavish?”</p><p>“Every right.”</p><p>“When I was here for your sake? If I have vexed you it is equally true
that I have neglected you. Your mother will see this as clearly as I do,
when you tell her.”</p></div> </div>
