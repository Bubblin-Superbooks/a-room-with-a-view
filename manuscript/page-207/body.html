kite, Miss Bartlett holding the string. Picture number two: the string
breaks.”</p><p>The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he
viewed things artistically. At the time he had given surreptitious tugs

have heard Miss Bartlett fall.”</p><p>“It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.</p><p>Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous,
contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst. He
cursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and
that Lucy was soaring up to reach him?</p><p>“Broken? What do you mean?”</p></div> </div>
